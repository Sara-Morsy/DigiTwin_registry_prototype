    <h1 class="font-bold">DigiTwin: Toward FAIR and Reproducible Infrastructure for Digital Twin Research</h1>

    <h2 class="font-bold">Defining the Digital Twin</h2>
    <p>
      According to the Digital Twin Consortium, a digital twin is a virtual representation of real-world entities and
      processes, synchronized at a specified frequency. This definition highlights the real-time data exchange and
      feedback mechanisms that form the foundation of digital twin architectures. Nevertheless, the interpretation of
      what constitutes a digital twin varies considerably between fields. In engineering and manufacturing, digital
      twins are implemented as complete cyber-physical systems that combine sensors, actuators, and analytics models.
      In contrast, in life sciences, a digital twin can refer to a computational model that represents biological or
      physiological processes without necessarily being connected to a physical system.
    </p>
    <p>
      This diversity of interpretation illustrates that the digital twin concept is use-case driven. Terms such as
      <em>virtual twin</em>, <em>digital shadow</em>, and <em>digital thread</em> are often used interchangeably, yet they
      describe different degrees of integration and functionality. The lack of a shared
      theoretical framework complicates efforts to compare or integrate systems across disciplines.
    </p>

    <h2 class="font-bold">The DigiTwin Database</h2>
    <p>
      DigiTwin, a curated platform designed to organize, structure, and
      centralize knowledge about digital twins across domains. Its purpose is to serve as a library of digital twin
      components, a network of real-world examples, and a discovery tool for identifying gaps, patterns, and
      opportunities in digital twin research.
    </p>
    <p>
      The database records metadata, data and infrastructure information from both academic and industrial sources, including
      performance metrics, readiness levels, maturity and use cases. It
      also captures information on the stage of technological maturity using the Technology Readiness Level (TRL)
      framework, ranging from TRL 1 (basic principles observed) to TRL 9 (system proven in operational environments).
    </p>
    <p>
      A central element of the DigiTwin database is its use of a periodic table framework developed by Digital Twin Consortium, that categorises digital twin components based on shared capabilities and architectural
      characteristics. This framework allows for a comparative understanding of maturity, interoperability, and
      reusability across different scientific and industrial applications.
    </p>
    <p>
      By adopting the FAIR data principles, the DigiTwin database aims
      to overcome the fragmentation currently present in digital twin research. Most existing work is scattered across
      publications and lacks standardized metadata. DigiTwin provides a foundation for systematic comparison and for
      building reusable, interoperable systems.
    </p>

    <h2 class="font-bold">Challenges in Digital Twin Research</h2>
    <p>
      Digital twin research currently faces a number of challenges that limit collaboration and progress. Many projects
      are developed in isolation within specific domains, with limited interoperability and inconsistent reporting
      standards. Definitions, architectures, and maturity levels vary widely, and most systems are still in the early
      stages of development.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the primary issues is the absence of standardised frameworks for describing and evaluating digital twins.
      Without common reporting standards, it becomes difficult to address fundamental research questions, such as which
      models or infrastructures are used in healthcare digital twins for predictive diagnostics, or how to distinguish
      between physics-based and data-driven twins. Similarly, assessing resilience, reliability, and reproducibility
      across systems remains a challenge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another barrier to progress is the lack of FAIR compliance. Without findable and interoperable metadata, knowledge
      about digital twins remains siloed, making it difficult to discover, compare, or reuse existing systems. This
      prevents the community from identifying common components or architectures that could accelerate innovation.
    </p>

    <h2 class="font-bold">Toward FAIR and Reproducible Digital Twin Infrastructures</h2>
    <p>
      The DigiTwin initiative advocates for the integration of FAIR principles into digital twin research and
      development. The goal is not to impose a universal standard but to create a structured framework where digital
      twins can be described, compared, and integrated systematically. Making digital twin data findable and reusable
      allows researchers to identify common components, benchmark performance, and share architectural insights across
      domains.
    </p>
    <p>
      The open-access nature of the DigiTwin database supports transparency and collaboration. By collecting community
      feedback and continuously expanding its coverage, the initiative promotes the development of reproducible and
      interoperable digital twin systems. Furthermore, collaborations with organizations such as ELIXIR can strengthen
      these efforts by providing shared ontologies, metadata standards, and infrastructures that support data exchange
      and reproducibility in life sciences.
