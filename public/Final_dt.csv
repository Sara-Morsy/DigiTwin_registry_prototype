Distributed digital twins for health monitoring: resource constrained aero-engine fleet management,Paper Metadata,Paper title,Distributed digital twins for health monitoring: resource constrained aero-engine fleet management
Distributed digital twins for health monitoring: resource constrained aero-engine fleet management,Paper Metadata,Paper DOI,10.1017/aer.2024.23
Distributed digital twins for health monitoring: resource constrained aero-engine fleet management,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,"Sensed data from high-value engineering systems is being increasingly exploited to optimise their operation and maintenance. In aerospace, returning all measured data to a central repository is prohibitively expensive, often causing useful, high-value data to be discarded. The ability to detect, prioritise and return useful data on asset and in real-time is vital to move toward more sustainable maintenance activities. We present a data-driven solution for on-line detection and prioritisation of anomalous data that is centrally processed and used to update individualised digital twins (DT) distributed onto remote machines. The DT is embodied as a convolutional neural network (CNN) optimised for real-time execution on a resource constrained gas turbine monitoring computer. The CNN generates a state prediction with uncertainty, which is used as a metric to select informative data for transfer to a remote fleet monitoring system. The received data is screened for faults before updating the weights on the CNN, which are synchronised between real and virtual asset. Results show the successful detection of a known in-flight engine fault and the collection of data related to high novelty pre-cursor events that were previously unrecognised. We demonstrate that data related to novel operation are also identified for transfer to the fleet monitoring system, allowing model improvement by retraining. In addition to these industrial dataset results, reproducible examples are provided for a public domain NASA dataset. The data prioritisation solution is capable of running in real-time on production-standard low-power embedded hardware and is deployed on the Rolls-Royce Pearl 15 engines."

Domain adaptation with transfer learning for pasture digital twins,Paper Metadata,Paper title,Domain adaptation with transfer learning for pasture digital twins  
Domain adaptation with transfer learning for pasture digital twins,Paper Metadata,Paper DOI,10.1017/eds.2024.6  
Domain adaptation with transfer learning for pasture digital twins,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,"Domain adaptation is important in agriculture because agricultural systems have their own individual characteristics. Applying the same treatment practices (e.g., fertilization) to different systems may not have the desired effect due to those characteristics. Domain adaptation is also an inherent aspect of digital twins. In this work, we examine the potential of transfer learning for domain adaptation in pasture digital twins. We use a synthetic dataset of grassland pasture simulations to pretrain and fine-tune machine learning metamodels for nitrogen response rate prediction. We investigate the outcome in locations with diverse climates, and examine the effect on the results of including more weather and agricultural management practices data during the pretraining phase. We find that transfer learning seems promising to make the models adapt to new conditions. Moreover, our experiments show that adding more weather data on the pretraining phase has a small effect on fine-tuned model performance compared to adding more management practices. This is an interesting finding that is worth further investigation in future studies.  "

DPART -A DIGITAL TWIN FRAMEWORK FOR THE MACHINING DOMAIN,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,"Todays' heterogeneous manufacturing environments and isolated manufacturing elements hinder the realization of a complete and data consistent digital twin. Against this background, an increased connectivity based on the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) might be the future key enabler for the digital twin. However, it requires each domain to transfer, rearrange and rethink their individual data solutions in a framework that is IIoT-ready. This paper presents an IIoT-based implementation of a digital twin framework for machining, enabling the creation of a complete and data consistent digital twin throughout process planning, manufacturing and quality assurance. Different use cases are introduced based on the example of a blade integrated disk for modern turbofan engines.  "

EAI Endorsed Transactions on Industrial Networks and Intelligent Systems,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,"Interference has always been the main threat to the performance of traditional WiFi networks and next-generation moving forward. The problem can be solved with transmit power control(TPC). However, to accomplish this, an information-gathering process is required. But this brings overhead concerns that decrease the throughput. Moreover, mitigation of interference relies on the selection of transmit powers. In other words, the control scheme should select the optimum configuration relative to other possibilities based on the total interference, and this requires an extensive search. Furthermore, bidirectional communication in real-time needs to exist to control the transmit powers based on the current situation. Based on these challenges, we propose a complete solution with Digital Twin WiFi Networks (DTWN). Contrarily to other studies, with the agent programs installed on the APs in the physical layer of this architecture, we enable information-gathering without causing overhead to the wireless medium. Additionally, we employ Q-learning-based TPC in the Brain Layer to find the best configuration given the current situation. Consequently, we accomplish real-time monitoring and management thanks to the digital twin. Then, we evaluate the performance of the proposed approach through total interference and throughput metrics over the increasing number of users. Furthermore, we show that the proposed DTWN model outperforms existing schemes."

Effectiveness of creating digital twins with different digital dentition models and cone-beam computed tomography,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,"Distortion of dentition may occur in cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) scans due to artifacts, and further imaging is frequently required to produce digital twins. The use of a plaster model is common; however, it has certain drawbacks. This study aimed to assess the feasibility of different digital dentition models over that of plaster casts. Plaster models, alginate impressions, intraoral scan (IOS) images, and CBCT images of 20 patients were obtained. The desktop model scanner was used to scan the alginate impression twice, five minutes and two hours after impression-making. Using an IOS, the full arch was scanned in segments using CS 3600 and simultaneously with i700 wireless. The digital twins obtained from the alginate impression and IOS were superimposed with those obtained from the plaster cast. The differences and distances at each reference point were measured. Scans of alginate impressions after two hours showed the greatest discrepancies, but these were all less than the CBCT voxel size of 0.39 mm. Alginate impression scans and IOS are suitable supplements to CBCT compared to the plaster model. Accuracy can be improved by scanning the alginate impression within five minutes or by intraoral scanning of the entire arch with segmentation."

Elevator fault diagnosis based on digital twin and PINNs-e-RGCN,Paper Metadata,Paper title,Elevator fault diagnosis based on digital twin and PINNs-e-RGCN  
Elevator fault diagnosis based on digital twin and PINNs-e-RGCN,Paper Metadata,Paper DOI,10.1038/s41598-024-78784-7  
Elevator fault diagnosis based on digital twin and PINNs-e-RGCN,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,"The rapid development of urbanization has led to a continuous rise in number of elevators. This has led to elevator failures from time to time. At present, although there are some studies on elevator fault diagnosis, they are more or less limited by the lack of data to make the research more superficial. For such complex special equipment as elevator, it is difficult to obtain reliable and sufficient data to train the fault diagnosis model. To address this issue, this paper first establishes a numerical model of vertical vibration for elevators with three degrees of freedom. The obtained motion equations are then used as constraints to acquire simulated vibration data through PINNs. Next, the proposed e-RGCN is employed for elevator fault diagnosis. Finally, experimental validation shows that the fault diagnosis accuracy with the participation of digital twins exceeds 90%, and the accuracy of the proposed model reaches 96.61%, significantly higher than that of other comparative models.

CycleStyleGAN-Based Knowledge Transfer for a Machining Digital Twin,Paper Metadata,Paper DOI,10.3389/frai.2021.767451
CycleStyleGAN-Based Knowledge Transfer for a Machining Digital Twin,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,"Digitalisation of manufacturing is a crucial component of the Industry 4.0 transformation. The digital twin is an important tool for enabling real-time digital access to precise information about physical systems and for supporting process optimisation via the translation of the associated big data into actionable insights. Although a variety of frameworks and conceptual models addressing the requirements and advantages of digital twins has been suggested in the academic literature, their implementation has received less attention. The work presented in this paper aims to make a proposition that considers the novel challenges introduced for data analysis in the presence of heterogeneous and dynamic cyber-physical systems in Industry 4.0. The proposed approach defines a digital twin simulation tool that captures the dynamics of a machining vibration signal from a source model and adapts them to a given target environment. This constitutes a flexible approach to knowledge extraction from the existing manufacturing simulation models, as information from both physics-based and data-driven solutions can be elicited this way. Therefore, an opportunity to reuse the costly established systems is made available to the manufacturing businesses, and the paper presents a process optimisation framework for such use case. The proposed approach is implemented as a domain adaptation algorithm based on the generative adversarial network model. The novel CycleStyleGAN architecture extends the CycleGAN model with a style-based signal encoding. The implemented model is validated in an experimental scenario that aims to replicate a real-world manufacturing knowledge transfer problem. The experiment shows that the transferred information enables the reduction of the required target domain data by one order of magnitude."

D2EcoSys: Decentralized Digital Twin EcoSystem Empower Co-Creation City-Level Digital Twins,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,"A city-level digital twin is a critical enabling technology to construct a smart city that helps improve citizens' living conditions and quality of life. Currently, research and development regarding the digital replica city are pursued worldwide. However, many research projects only focus on creating the 3D city model. A mechanism to involve key players, such as data providers, service providers, and application developers, is essential for constructing the digital replica city and producing various city applications. Based on this motivation, the authors of this paper are pursuing a research project, namely Decentralized Digital Twin EcoSystem (D2EcoSys), to create an ecosystem to advance (and self-grow) the digital replica city regarding time and space directions, city services, and values. This paper introduces an overview of the D2EcoSys project: vision, problem statement, and approach. In addition, the paper discusses the recent research results regarding networking technologies and demonstrates an early testbed built in the Kashiwa-no-ha smart city.  "

Decentralized digital twins of complex dynamical systems,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,"In this article, we introduce a decentralized digital twin (DDT) modeling framework and its potential applications in computational science and engineering. The DDT methodology is based on the idea of federated learning, a subfield of machine learning that promotes knowledge exchange without disclosing actual data. Clients can learn an aggregated model cooperatively using this method while maintaining complete client-specific training data. We use a variety of dynamical systems, which are frequently used as prototypes for simulating complex transport processes in spatiotemporal systems, to show the viability of the DDT framework. Our findings suggest that constructing highly accurate decentralized digital twins in complex nonlinear spatiotemporal systems may be made possible by federated machine learning.  "

Deconstructing Barisanus' medieval casting technology based on digital twins,Paper Metadata,Paper DOI,10.1038/s41598-025-91168-9  
Deconstructing Barisanus' medieval casting technology based on digital twins,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,"The Italian 12th-century copper alloy doors of Barisanus have long been the subject of art historical studies and have recently been fully documented photogrammetrically and archaeometrically. In addition, digital twins of the three Barisanus doors in Ravello, Trani and Monreale have been produced and made available in open access for further research. These digital twins, together with the orthophotos produced, allow precise and repeatable measurements of the different metal parts of the doors, such as panels and frieze elements. This, and by taking into account the solid shrinkage of metals during the casting process, allowed for the reconstruction of the production sequence for each of the 20 single motif panels present on all three doors, and, finally, also for the establishment of the production sequence of the three doors as a whole-heavily discussed in art history researchwith rather astonishing results. Moreover, bronze casting techniques used and the use of moulds and models are discussed, painting a more detailed picture that goes beyond the often purported dichotomy of lost wax vs. sand casting.

Deep learning and IoT enabled digital twin framework for monitoring open-pit coal mines,Paper Metadata,Paper title,Deep learning and IoT enabled digital twin framework for monitoring open-pit coal mines  
Deep learning and IoT enabled digital twin framework for monitoring open-pit coal mines,Paper Metadata,Paper DOI,10.3389/fenrg.2023.1265111  
Deep learning and IoT enabled digital twin framework for monitoring open-pit coal mines,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,"Early detection of cracks enables timely mitigation and maintenance actions, ensuring the safety of personnel and equipment within the open-pit coal mine. Monitoring open-pit coal mines and cracks is essential for the safety of workers and for saving national assets. Digital twins (DTs) can be crucial in open-pit coal mine crack detection. DTs enable continuous real-time monitoring of the openpit mine, including its structures and surrounding environment. Various sensors and internet-of-things devices can be deployed to collect data on factors such as ground movement and strain. Integrating this data into the DT makes it possible to identify and analyze anomalous behavior or changes that may indicate crack formation or propagation. Deep learning-based networks are a crucial factor in detecting open-pit coal mine cracks. In this work, we propose a deep learning-based densely connected lightweight network incorporated into the DT-based framework for detecting cracks and taking predictive maintenancebased decisions by combining historical data, real-time sensor data, and predictive models. The proposed DT-based framework provides insights into the potential crack formation, allowing for proactive maintenance and mitigation measures. We compare the performance of our proposed network on different evaluation measures such as precision, recall, overall accuracy, mean average precision, F1-score, and kappa coefficient, where our proposed lightweight multiscale feature fusion-based network outperformed all other state-of-theart deep neural networks. We also achieved the best performance on mean average precision by surpassing all other models. Additionally, we also compared the performance of our proposed network with U-Net and recurrent neural network on model training and prediction time benchmarks by outperforming those cutting-edge models.

Deep Learning-Based Modeling of 5G Core Control Plane for 5G Network Digital Twin,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,"Digital twin serves as a crucial facilitator in the advancement and implementation of emerging technologies within 5G and beyond networks. However, the intricate structure and diverse functionalities of the existing 5G core network, especially the control plane, present challenges in constructing core network digital twins. In this paper, we propose two novel datadriven architectures for modeling the 5G control plane and implement corresponding deep learning models, namely 5GC-Seq2Seq and 5GC-former, based on the Vanilla Seq2Seq model and Transformer decoder respectively. We also present a solution enabling the interconversion of signaling messages and lengthlimited vectors to construct a dataset. The experiments are based on 5G core network signaling messages collected by the Spirent C50 network tester, encompassing various procedures such as registration, handover, and PDU sessions. The results show that 5GC-Seq2Seq achieves a 99.997% F1-score (a metric measuring the accuracy of positive samples) in single UE scenarios with a simple structure, but exhibits significantly reduced performance in handling concurrency. In contrast, 5GC-former surpasses 99.999% F1-score while maintaining robust performance under concurrent UE scenarios by constructing a more complex and highly parallel model. These findings validate that our method accurately replicates the principal functionalities of the 5G core network control plane."

Digital twin and fuzzy framework for supply chain sustainability risk assessment and management in supplier selection,Paper Metadata,Paper DOI,10.1038/s41598-024-67226-z
Digital twin and fuzzy framework for supply chain sustainability risk assessment and management in supplier selection,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,"Risks in the supply chain can damage many companies and organizations due to sustainability risk factors. This study evaluates the supply chain risk assessment and management and then selects the best supplier in a gas company in Egypt. A comprehensive methodology can use the experts' opinions who use the linguistic variables in the spherical fuzzy numbers (SFNs) to evaluate the criteria and suppliers in this study based on their views. Selecting the best supplier is a complex task due to various criteria related to supply chain risk assessment, such as supply risks, environmental risks, financial risks, regularity risks, political risk, ethical risks, and technology risks and their sub-criteria. This study suggested a new combined model with multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) under a spherical fuzzy set (SFS) environment to overcome uncertainty and incomplete data in the assessment process. The MCDM methodology has two methods: the Entropy and COmbinative Distance-based Assessment (CODAS) methods. The SFS-Entropy is used to compute supply chain risk assessment and management criteria weights. The SFS-CODAS method is used to rank the supplier. The main results show that supply risks have the highest importance, followed by financial and environmental risks, and ethical risks have the lowest risk importance. The criteria weights were changed under sensitivity analysis to show the stability and validation of the results obtained from the suggested methodology. The comparative analysis is implemented with other MCDM methods named TOPSIS, VIKOR, MARCOS, COPRAS, WASPAS, and MULTIMOORA methods under the SFS environment. This study can help managers and organizations select the best supplier with the lowest sustainability risks."

Digital Twin Approach for Maintenance Management,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,"After years of slightest attention to the environment, low productivity, and least rates of technological innovation, the construction sector has started a slow but in-depth review of its statutes and priorities. The ongoing ecological and digital transition opens to new opportunities connected to the implemental policies of Industry 4.0-at now Industry 5.0-and related enabling technologies. Opportunities that strongly reaffirm the need for innovative, responsible, and sustainable governance of the life cycle of buildings, placing it in the new perspective of Digital Twin approach. Starting from this scenario, the paper presents some ongoing upgrade of a maintenance management model expressly aimed at optimizing activities in the operation and maintenance phase from which evident economic, environmental, and social extra costs arise."

Engineering Management in Production and Services,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,"Due to Dimension Studios and Unsigned Group, by likeness and movement digitization, the human supermodel Eva Herzigová's highly realistic metahuman and 3D digital twin lead to perpetual career extension (e.g., on virtual runway shows by catwalk replication or in advertising campaigns by particular pose adoption), including in virtual worlds such as metaverse spaces, by use of extended reality technologies, in terms of virtual clothing, digital hair, skin texture, facial and body expressions, and makeup styling as avatar appearance and persona. In this paper, we show how, by likeness capturing (e.g., signature walk by motion capture shoot for face and body movement tracking) and virtual clothing, Eva Herzigová's hyperreal 3D avatar (lifelike 3D digital human clone or realistic virtual human) is configured with subsequent restyled hair and make-up, 3D clothing modeling, and extended reality fashion shows on virtual catwalks or campaign shoots. We clarify that photographic reference materials and a sensorbased motion capture suit assisted Metahuman Creator in capturing facial and motion data for Eva Herzigová's digital avatar, configuring realistic depiction and virtual activations of beauty standards, in addition to digital likeness, signature style, talent representation, and narrations, typifying digital human creation and presence in virtual worlds (e.g., for metaverse-based shoots). We conclude that Eva Herzigová's hyperrealistic 3D digital human twin and MetaHuman avatar operate as a styled virtual alter ego and versatile personal brand extension by motion capture technologies for immersive virtual fashion shows, live video streams and broadcast, and digital wearable modeling."

Digital Twinning for Productivity Improvement Opportunities with Robotic Process Automation: Case of Greenfield Hospital,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,"Hospitals of the future need to embrace new, disruptive, and innovative technologies, and prudently consider the cost of such technological investments to ensure that the technologies can interface well with human operators, without the high financial commitment. Such hospitals look to improve operational efficiency and productivity to be able to treat more patients without increasing cost and justify the capital investment. Put simply, the hospital staff will in future co-work and collaborate with robotic technologies in a shared workspace to deliver the same level of patient care if not better. For this to happen, there is a need to appreciate how the current human effort can be integrated seamlessly with Robotic Process Automation (RPA) activities in a hospital setting and to visually show to the operations/logistics personnel the attendant challenges/ bottlenecks. We study a Greenfield hospital in Singapore and provide a digital twin of its future operations with RPA solutions. Specifically, we design an efficient logistics system (central sterile services, materials management, food, pharmacy, linen), develop robust RPA solutions, and minimize the disruptions from automation introduction. The transportation system within the hospital, dispatching rule of the lifts and robots, are optimized through extensive simulation."

Digital twins based on augmented reality of measurement instruments for the implementation of a cyber-physical system,Paper Metadata,Paper title,Digital twins based on augmented reality of measurement instruments for the implementation of a cyber-physical system
Digital twins based on augmented reality of measurement instruments for the implementation of a cyber-physical system,Paper Metadata,Paper DOI,10.1016/j.cose.2022.102984
Digital twins based on augmented reality of measurement instruments for the implementation of a cyber-physical system,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,"The recent increase on the Internet of Things and Industry 4.0 fields has led the research topics to investigate on the innovative technologies that could support these emerging topics in different area of applications. In particular, the current trends are to close the gap between the physical and digital worlds, thus originating the so-called Cyber-Physical System (CPS). A relevant feature of the CPS is the digital twin, i.e., a digital replica of a process/product with which user can interact to operate on the real world. In this paper, the authors propose an innovative approach exploiting an Augmented Reality solution as Digital Twin for the measurement instrument to obtain a tight connection between the measurements as physical world and the Internet of Things as digital applications. In fact, by means of the adoption of the 3D scanning strategy, Augmented Reality software and with the development of a suitable connection between the instrument and the digital world, a Cyber-Physical System has been realized as an IoT platform that collect and control the real measurement instrument and makes its available in Augmented Reality. An application example involving a digital storage oscilloscope is finally presented to highlight the efficacy of the proposed approach."

Digital twins for metrology; metrology for digital twins,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,"Digital twinning is a rapidly growing area of research. Digital twins combine models and data to provide up-to-date information about the state of a system. They support reliable decision-making in fields such as structural monitoring and advanced manufacturing. The use of metrology data to update models in this way offers benefits in many areas, including metrology itself. The recent activities in digitalisation of metrology offer a great opportunity to make metrology data 'twin-friendly' and to incorporate digital twins into metrological processes. This paper discusses key features of digital twins that will inform their use in metrology and measurement, highlights the links between digital twins and virtual metrology, outlines what use metrology can make of digital twins and how metrology and measured data can support the use of digital twins, and suggests potential future developments that will maximise the benefits achieved.

Digital Twin Technology: The Future of Predicting Neurological Complications of Pediatric Cancers and Their Treatment,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,"Healthcare technologies have seen a surge in utilization during the COVID 19 pandemic. Remote patient care, virtual follow-up and other forms of futurism will likely see further adaptation both as a preparational strategy for future pandemics and due to the inevitable evolution of artificial intelligence. This manuscript theorizes the healthcare applications of digital twin technology. Digital twin is a triune concept that involves a physical model, a virtual counterpart, and the interplay between the two constructs. This interface between computer science and medicine is a new frontier with broad potential applications. We propose that digital twin technology can exhaustively and methodologically analyze the associations between a physical cancer patient and a corresponding digital counterpart with the goal of isolating predictors of neurological sequalae of disease. This proposition stems from the premise that data science can complement clinical acumen to scientifically inform the diagnostics, treatment planning and prognostication of cancer care. Specifically, digital twin could predict neurological complications through its utilization in precision medicine, modelling cancer care and treatment, predictive analytics and machine learning, and in consolidating various spectra of clinician opinions."

Digital twin-assisted intelligent fault diagnosis for bearings,Paper Metadata,Paper title,Digital twin-assisted intelligent fault diagnosis for bearings
Digital twin-assisted intelligent fault diagnosis for bearings,Paper Metadata,Paper DOI,10.1088/1361-6501/ad5f4c
Digital twin-assisted intelligent fault diagnosis for bearings,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,"Data-driven intelligent fault diagnosis methods generally require a large amount of labeled data and considerable time to train network models. However, obtaining sufficient labeled data in practical industrial scenarios has always been a challenge, which hinders the practical application of data-driven methods. A digital twin (DT) model of rolling bearings can generate labeled training dataset for various bearing faults, supplementing the limited measured data. This paper proposes a novel DT-assisted approach to address the issue of limited measured data for bearing fault diagnosis. First, a dynamic model of bearing with damages is introduced to generate simulated bearing acceleration vibration signals. A DT model is constructed in Simulink, where the model parameters are updated based on the actual system behavior. Second, the structural parameters of the DT model are adaptively updated using least squares method with the measured data. Third, a Vision Transformer (ViT) -based network, integrated with short-time Fourier transform, is developed to achieve accurate fault diagnosis. By applying short-time Fourier transform at the input end of the ViT network, the model effectively extracts additional information from the vibration signals. Pre-training the network with an extensive dataset from miscellaneous tasks enables the acquisition of pre-trained weights, which are subsequently transferred to the bearing fault diagnosis task. Experiments results verify that the proposed approach can achieve higher diagnostic accuracy and better stability."

Digital Twin Based Laboratory for Control Engineering Education,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,"The Covid-19 pandemic has made online learning the main choice in learning modes. For control engineering education that requires substantial laboratory practices as part of the learning process, online learning is a challenge in itself. It is difficult for students to gain experience and understanding of physical phenomena through online learning. Two approaches are commonly used to provide learning experiences that resembles practices in a traditional laboratory, namely virtual laboratory and remote laboratory. The drawback of virtual laboratory is that simulation eliminate the interaction aspect with physical devices make students miss the mental experiences of dealing with physical objects that important for engineering students, while the remote laboratory requires high cost and less flexible. This paper proposes another approach to overcome the shortcomings by utilizing a technology known as Digital Twin. Digital Twin based laboratory provides digital or virtual twin of a physical system that are interconnected with one another via the internet. The interconnection of the physical system and its virtual twin preserve the physical interaction and also increase the flexibility of the laboratory. Preliminary implementation and experiments show that the propose approach works properly. Users are able to manipulate the real plant remotely, and to observe almost identical dynamics of the real plant and the 3D visualization of the virtual plant."

Digital twin based monitoring and control for DC-DC converters,Paper Metadata,Paper title,Digital twin based monitoring and control for DC-DC converters  
Digital twin based monitoring and control for DC-DC converters,Paper Metadata,Paper DOI,10.1038/s41467-023-41248-z  
Digital twin based monitoring and control for DC-DC converters,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,"The monitoring and control of DC-DC converters have become key issues since DC-DC converters are gradually playing increasingly crucial roles in power electronics applications such as electric vehicles and renewable energy systems. As an emerging and transforming technology, the digital twin, which is a dynamic virtual replica of a physical system, can potentially provide solutions for the monitoring and control of DC-DC converters. This work discusses the design and implementation of the digital twin DC-DC converter in detail. The key features of the physical and twin systems are outlined, and the control architecture is provided. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed digital twin method, four possible cases that may occur during the practical control scenarios of DC-DC converter applications are discussed. Simulations and experimental verification are conducted, showing that the digital twin can dynamically track the physical DC-DC converter, detect the failure of the physical controller and replace it in real time.

Digital Twin-Based Automated Fault Diagnosis in Industrial IoT Applications,Paper Metadata,Paper title,Digital Twin-Based Automated Fault Diagnosis in Industrial IoT Applications
Digital Twin-Based Automated Fault Diagnosis in Industrial IoT Applications,Paper Metadata,Paper DOI,10.32604/cmc.2023.034048
Digital Twin-Based Automated Fault Diagnosis in Industrial IoT Applications,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,"In recent years, Digital Twin (DT) has gained significant interest from academia and industry due to the advanced in information technology, communication systems, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Cloud Computing (CC), and Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). The main concept of the DT is to provide a comprehensive tangible, and operational explanation of any element, asset, or system. However, it is an extremely dynamic taxonomy developing in complexity during the life cycle that produces a massive amount of engendered data and information. Likewise, with the development of AI, digital twins can be redefined and could be a crucial approach to aid the Internet of Things (IoT)-based DT applications for transferring the data and value onto the Internet with better decision-making. Therefore, this paper introduces an efficient DT-based fault diagnosis model based on machine learning (ML) tools. In this framework, the DT model of the machine is constructed by creating the simulation model. In the proposed framework, the Genetic algorithm (GA) is used for the optimization task to improve the classification accuracy. Furthermore, we evaluate the proposed fault diagnosis framework using performance metrics such as precision, accuracy, F-measure, and recall. The proposed framework is comprehensively examined using the triplex pump fault diagnosis. The experimental results demonstrated that the hybrid GA-ML method gives outstanding results compared to ML methods like Logistic Regression (LR), Naïve Bayes (NB), and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The suggested framework achieves the highest accuracy of 95% for the employed hybrid GA-SVM. The proposed framework will effectively help industrial operators make an appropriate decision concerning the fault analysis for IIoT applications in the context of Industry 4.0."

Digital twin-based multi-level task rescheduling for robotic assembly line,Paper Metadata,Paper DOI,10.1038/s41598-023-28630-z  
Digital twin-based multi-level task rescheduling for robotic assembly line,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,"Assembly is a critical step in the manufacturing process. Robotic assembly technology in automatic production lines has greatly improved the production efficiency. However, in assembly process, dynamic disturbances such as processing time change and advance delivery may occur, which cause the scheduling deviation. Traditional scheduling methods are not sufficient to meet the real-time and adaptive requirements in smart manufacturing. Digital twin (DT) has the characteristics of virtual-reality interaction and real-time mapping. In this paper, we propose a DT-based framework of task rescheduling for robotic assembly line (RAL) and its key methodologies, thus to realize the timely and dynamic adjustment of scheduling plan under uncertain interferences. First, a DT model of RAL task rescheduling composed of physical entity (PE), virtual entity (VE), and virtual-reality interaction mechanism is proposed. Then, a mathematical model is established. By analyzing the adaptive objective thresholds from the perspectives of event trigger and user demand trigger, a DT-driven multi-level (production unit level and line level) rescheduling strategy is proposed. Taking both the computing time and solution quality into consideration, the precedence graph is introduced to propose a rescheduling approach based on an improved discrete fireworks algorithm. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed model and approach are verified by task scheduling experiments of RAL.  "

Digital Twin-Based Production-Logistics Synchronization System for Satellite Mass Assembly Shop-Floor,Paper Metadata,Paper DOI,10.1186/s10033-024-01148-9
Digital Twin-Based Production-Logistics Synchronization System for Satellite Mass Assembly Shop-Floor,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,"In recent years, the rapid development of large-scale satellite constellations has challenged the mass production capabilities of satellite manufacturers. Assembly is the last and critical phase of satellite production. Achieving satellite mass assembly is the key to realizing satellite mass production. To this end, satellite manufacturers are working to construct the satellite mass assembly shop-floor (SMAS) to enable moving assembly. However, there is still a lack of a modularized manufacturing system oriented to flexible production for SMAS, as well as disturbance detection methods and production-logistics synchronization methods to deal with various disturbances. Therefore, this paper proposes a digital twin-based production-logistics synchronization system (DT-PLSS) for SMAS. The framework of DT-PLSS is introduced first. In this framework, DT-PLSS can achieve modular construction, as well as distributed management and control. Based on the proposed framework, the construction methods of resource level digital twin (DT), workstation level DT, and shop-floor level DT in SMAS are discussed. The DT-based disturbance detection method for SMAS is presented, aiming to detect or predict different types of disturbances and to analyze the effect of disturbances. Then, a DT enhanced production-logistics synchronization mechanism for SMAS is proposed. With this mechanism, the logistics distribution in the dynamic shop-floor environment and production-logistics synchronization under various disturbances can be realized. Finally, a case study in a real SMAS verifies the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed system and methods. This research proposes a practical framework and system which could realize disturbance detection, logistics distribution, and the production-logistics synchronization in complex SMAS scenario effectively."

Digital twin-based progress monitoring management model through reality capture to extended reality technologies (DRX),Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,"Purpose -The purpose of this research is to develop a generic framework of a digital twin (DT)-based automated construction progress monitoring through reality capture to extended reality (RC-to-XR). Design/methodology/approach -IDEF0 data modeling method has been designed to establish an integration of reality capturing technologies by using BIM, DTs and XR for automated construction progress monitoring. Structural equation modeling (SEM) method has been used to test the proposed hypotheses and develop the skill model to examine the reliability, validity and contribution of the framework to understand the DRX model's effectiveness if implemented in real practice. Findings -The research findings validate the positive impact and importance of utilizing technology integration in a logical framework such as DRX, which provides trustable, real-time, transparent and digital construction progress monitoring. Practical implications -DRX system captures accurate, real-time and comprehensive data at construction stage, analyses data and information precisely and quickly, visualizes information and reports in a real scale environment, facilitates information flows and communication, learns from itself, historical data and accessible online data to predict future actions, provides semantic and digitalize construction information with analytical capabilities and optimizes decision-making process. Originality/value -The research presents a framework of an automated construction progress monitoring system that integrates BIM, various reality capturing technologies, DT and XR technologies (VR, AR and MR), arraying the steps on how these technologies work collaboratively to create, capture, generate, analyze, manage and visualize construction progress data, information and reports."

Digital Twin concept of a force measuring device based on the finite element method,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,"In the framework of EMPIR project ComTraForce, the Digital Twin (DT) concept of force measurement device is developed. DT aims to shade static, continuous as well as dynamic calibration processes, preserving data quality and collecting calibration data for improved Decision-making. To illustrate the developed DT concept, a prototype realisation for static and continuous force calibration processes is developed, involving simulation with ANSYS engineering software. The focus of the current work is placed on the data connection between the physical device and the DT. The DT model is validated using traceable measurements.  "

Digital Twin conceptual framework for improving critical infrastructure resilience,Paper Metadata,Paper title,Digital Twin conceptual framework for improving critical infrastructure resilience
Digital Twin conceptual framework for improving critical infrastructure resilience,Paper Metadata,Paper DOI,10.1515/auto-2021-0104
Digital Twin conceptual framework for improving critical infrastructure resilience,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,"Critical infrastructures are the backbone of our societies with increasingly complex and networked characteristics and high availability demands. This makes them vulnerable to a wide range of threats that can lead to major incidents. Resilience is a concept that describes a system's ability to absorb and respond to disturbances, as well as to learn from the past and anticipate new threats. In this article, we apply the Digital Twin concept to the infrastructure domain to improve the system's resilience capabilities. We conduct a comprehensive requirements analysis related to infrastructure characteristics, crisis management and resilience measures. As a result, we propose a Digital Twin Conceptual Framework for critical infrastructures. We conclude that the Digital Twin paradigm is well suited to enhance critical infrastructure resilience."

Digital twin conceptual framework for the operation and maintenance phase in the building’s lifecycle,Paper Metadata,Paper DOI,10.24425/ace.2024.150975
Digital twin conceptual framework for the operation and maintenance phase in the building’s lifecycle,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,"AECO is struggling with data loss, inefficient processes and low productivity in asset management. The remedy to these problems seems to be the idea of Digital Twin (DT). However, the frameworks proposed so far do not always support a solution to these problems. This paper conducts an extensive literature review to develop a conceptual framework for the Operation and Maintenance (O&M) phase for building facilities. The conceptual framework takes into account the increasingly popular Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies. The foundation, however, is Building Information Modeling (BIM) technology. The presented framework, after appropriate modifications, can also be applied to infrastructure facilities or city fragments. The paper presents limitations and directions for further research. The DT paradigm has been adopted and its adoption is ongoing. Its implementation will progress in the coming years. The advantages and benefits are certainly more numerous than the barriers and risks posed by the use of DT."

Digital twin designs with generative AI: crafting a comprehensive framework for manufacturing systems,Paper Metadata,Paper DOI,10.1007/s10845-025-02583-8  
Digital twin designs with generative AI: crafting a comprehensive framework for manufacturing systems,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,"The increasing prevalence of digital twins across various industries is attributed to their capacity for enhancing performance, minimizing downtime, and improving efficiency in the manufacturing process. These virtual models enable users to monitor and analyze the real-time behavior of physical assets, systems, or processes. However, the design of digital twins presents several challenges, such as excessive time costs, security risks, data accuracy, privacy concerns, and complexity in chosen components. This research paper introduces a comprehensive framework that effectively and flexibly addresses these challenges in digital twin development by employing S4 features, a Morphological Matrix, and Fuzzy TOPSIS. The proposed framework draws inspiration from methodologies utilized in product design and leverages a morphological matrix to identify and categorize diverse S4 features. These features are crucial in creating smart, sustainable, sensing, and socially impactful digital twins. Additionally, Fuzzy TOPSIS is employed to determine the optimal digital twin structure. The digital twin is divided into a physical and virtual model, interconnected and interactively communicated through a dedicated interface model. Furthermore, the framework integrates human knowledge into the digital twin structure, enhancing its robustness. When combined with a Large Natural Language Processing model, a comparative analysis of the digital twin structure is presented. A reconfigurable micromachine is used as a case study to validate the proposed approach. The results demonstrate the proposed framework's applicability for developing digital twins within the manufacturing industry. The main contribution of this paper is the innovative integration of human expertise and generative AI in a digital twin design framework. This approach provides a structured method that aligns the solution closely with industry requirements and offers a scalable and adaptable design methodology validated through practical applications. This framework is particularly valuable when dealing with a high number of devices that are challenging for human experts to evaluate rapidly in digital twin design.  "

Digital twin enabled sustainable urban road planning,Paper Metadata,Paper title,Digital twin enabled sustainable urban road planning
Digital twin enabled sustainable urban road planning,Paper Metadata,Paper DOI,10.1016/j.scs.2017.03.009
Digital twin enabled sustainable urban road planning,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,"Sustainable urban road planning should endeavour to meet current and future traffic-related demands and achieve financial, environmental, and social benefits, which is a complex and interdisciplinary issue that needs to consider various factors and data. Multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) can provide reasonable solutions, and some existing studies integrated MCDM with geographic information system (GIS) technology. This paper presents an urban road planning approach based on digital twin (DT), MCDM, and GIS called DT-MCDM-GIS framework. DT can digitalize the physical world to provide various data for the whole process; MCDM can provide criteria and evaluation methods; GIS can provide an integrated environment for analysis. Building demolition and land use, traffic congestion, driving route selection habits, air quality, and noise are all considered in the framework for urban road planning. The proposed approach can provide a functional, economic, people-friendly, eco-friendly urban road planning scheme considering new road construction and existing old road widening to alleviate traffic congestion and provide an alternative route for drivers that conforms to their habits."

Digital twin for decision support system of industrial utility management,Paper Metadata,Paper title,Digital twin for decision support system of industrial utility management
Digital twin for decision support system of industrial utility management,Paper Metadata,Paper DOI,10.69598/sehs.18.24040002
Digital twin for decision support system of industrial utility management,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,"Manufacturing and industrial operations rely heavily on energy that is generated mostly from fossil fuels, such as coal, oil, and natural gas, which harm the environment and contribute to climate change. Thus, renewable energy is being integrated into industrial processes to lessen environmental effects and reduce fossil fuel usage. However, the renewable source performance process can be greatly affected by disturbances and constraints, such as ambient air temperature and relative humidity, minimum utility consumption, and the total energy required, making effective control difficult. This study proposes a digital twin built with machine learning regression techniques for load demand forecasting as a decision-support system for industrial utility management. From the results, the ensemble tree (ET) model produced the highest accuracy, based on validation and test dataset root mean squared error values of 23.164 and 27.558, respectively, and R 2 values of 0.96 and 0.95, respectively. The digital twin and load demand forecasting approaches effectively created an efficient operating schedule for industrial utility management. The ET model had a total error of 23.86%, substantially lower than the average load demand's total error of 65.29%. Therefore, the ET model with weather conditions in four scenarios could be recommended to optimize energy utilization when creating the operating schedule."

Digital twin for multi-scenario emergency of railway passenger stations,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,"Emergency disposal is a critical aspect for railway stations to ensure safety. This requires the implementation of emergency plan simulations and costeffective immersive drills. In the paper, we incorporate a set of disposals for events into emergency processes and model the personnel, supplies, and equipment to create multiple emergency scenarios. Additionally, we introduce a digital twin-based solution for multiple scenarios of emergencies. This solution completely restores the key components of a station in the information space and provides an immersive way for emergency disposals. The four-dimensional model used in the solution simulates and interacts with the station, and it is composed of the details of passenger station physical entity, multi-scenario emergency virtual entity, digital twin connection, and emergency twin service. The digital twin for versatile emergency events such as fire disaster, natural disaster (e.g., flood, earthquake), social security incident, and public health event have been constructed using the model. The solution was tested at Qinghe, a station during Beijing-Zhangjiakou highspeed railway in China. By utilizing the actual operation data of Qinghe, we validated the multi-scenario emergency drills, simulated the corresponding emergency disposal plans, and assessed the proposed solution from three aspects: the fidelity of the real-world simulation, coverage of the multiple emergency scenarios, and the user-friendliness. The evaluations indicate that the proposed solution attains good score and the acceptable level of system usability scale.  "

,Paper Metadata,Paper title,Conceptual Model and Technical Framework of Digital Twin Human Geographic Environment
,Paper Metadata,Paper DOI,10.11834/jrs.20232652
,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,"The paper proposes a conceptual model of the digital twin human geographic environment, elaborating its systematic connotation. It includes major components such as the real human geographic environment, the virtual human geographic environment, and their information interaction. A technical framework with a bilateral technology roadmap is proposed, featuring comprehensive perception and twin reproduction of the real environment, and intelligent feedback and manipulation of the virtual environment on the real. A hierarchical construction scheme covers five sub-platforms: collaborative monitoring and environmental awareness platform, multimodal full-scale database, intelligent modeling and simulation technology integration, high-performance spatiotemporal computing engine, and cross-domain knowledge application for decision making. The digital twin of Jiangxi Bailudong Academy is used as a case study. The paper aims to stimulate research coupling digital twins and human geographic environment for sustainable human geography development."

DIGITAL TWIN: INDUSTRIAL ROBOT KINEMATIC MODEL INTEGRATION TO THE VIRTUAL REALITY ENVIRONMENT,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,"Digital Twin (DT) concept nowadays is shown via the simulations of the manufacturing systems and included those production processes and parametric 3D models of the product. It is the primary method for planning, analysing and optimising the factory layout and processes. Moreover, work on management via the simulation in real-time is already done using Virtual Reality (VR) tools from a safe and remote environment. However, there is a list of limitation of such kind of digital systems, as connectivity speed and precision of the digital environment. The primary goal of this study is to access second listed limitation and on the example of the fully synchronised physical with its digital replica industrial robot, increase the level of precision of the developed DT environment. The proposed approach introduces transfer of the mathematical model to the virtual environment, thus creating a precise and scaled visual model of the Industrial Robot."

Digital twin key technology on rare earth process,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,"Digital twin can be defined as a digital equivalent of an object of which it can mirror its behavior and status or virtual replicas of real physical entities in Cyberspace. To an extent, it also can simulate and predict the states of equipment or systems through smart algorithms and massive data. Hence, the digital twin is emerging used in intelligent manufacturing Systems in real-time and predicting system failure and also has introduced into a variety of traditional industries such as construction, Agriculture. Rare earth production is a typical process industry, and its Extraction Process enjoys the top priority in the industry. However, the extraction process is usually characterized by nonlinear behavior, large time delays, and strong coupling of various process variables. In case of failures happened in the process, the whole line would be shut down. Therefore, the digital twin is introduced into the design of process simulation to promote the efficiency and intelligent level of the Extraction Process. This paper proposes the techniques to build the rare earth digital twin such as soft measurement of component content, component content process simulation, control optimization strategy, and virtual workshop, etc. At the end, the validity of the model is verified, and a case study is conducted to verify the feasibility of the whole Digital twin framework.

Digital twin mathematical models suggest individualized hemorrhagic shock resuscitation strategies Check for updates,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,"Background Optimizing resuscitation to reduce inflammation and organ dysfunction following human trauma-associated hemorrhagic shock is a major clinical hurdle. This is limited by the short duration of pre-clinical studies and the sparsity of early data in the clinical setting. Methods We sought to bridge this gap by linking preclinical data in a porcine model with clinical data from patients from the Prospective, Observational, Multicenter, Major Trauma Transfusion (PROMMTT) study via a three-compartment ordinary differential equation model of inflammation and coagulation. Results The mathematical model accurately predicts physiologic, inflammatory, and laboratory measures in both the porcine model and patients, as well as the outcome and time of death in the PROMMTT cohort. Model simulation suggests that resuscitation with plasma and red blood cells outperformed resuscitation with crystalloid or plasma alone, and that earlier plasma resuscitation reduced injury severity and increased survival time. Conclusions This workflow may serve as a translational bridge from pre-clinical to clinical studies in trauma-associated hemorrhagic shock and other complex disease settings.  "

Digital twin-driven strategic demolition plan for circular asset management of bridge infrastructures,Paper Metadata,Paper title,Digital twin-driven strategic demolition plan for circular asset management of bridge infrastructures
Digital twin-driven strategic demolition plan for circular asset management of bridge infrastructures,Paper Metadata,Paper DOI,10.1038/s41598-025-94117-8
Digital twin-driven strategic demolition plan for circular asset management of bridge infrastructures,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,"Economic growth plays an important role in the rapid increase in construction of transportation and bridge infrastructures, which in turn causes enormous greenhouse gas emissions contributing directly to climate change. An innovative and effective method, so-called Building Information Modeling (BIM), to sustainably manage detailed lifecycle of infrastructures, has been recently adopted to revolutionise the Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry. Its major function is to sustainably optimise all detailed stages of an infrastructure asset's lifecycle. A three-dimensional architectural BIM incorporating three additional dimensions (time, cost, and carbon emissions) has then been created in this study to virtualise the whole lifecycle performance of bridge infrastructure through BIM data. For circular asset management, multi-scale details of assets and infrastructures are indispensable. On this ground, these information dimensions are highly critical to asset managers to assure not only public safety, but also sustainability over the whole lifecycle. It is thus critical to quantify carbon footprint in order to identify better alternative solutions for construction and maintenance, resulting in carbon neutrality and carbon credit. Our digital twin (DT), driven by the BIM, has embedded demolition scenarios whose lifecycle cost and carbon footprint can be quantified and optimized simultaneously. Our study is the first to also demonstrate circular end-of-life management through strategic demolition planning that enhances circular economy practice. This aspect is novel and has not been commonly adopted in practice. Our study reveals that the construction stage of the asset lifecycle for this study is the main contributor to carbon emissions and costs stemming from raw materials and their productions. This eventually leads to significant waste at the end of asset's life, requiring strategic demolition plan to maximise reuse, repurpose, and recycle of materials, parts and components. Our innovative DT is capable of dealing with the cradle-to-cradle lifecycle management. Another co-benefit of using the BIM-based digital twin is to minimise streamlining design, re-work, mitigating risk, and real time processing of design changes in all stakeholders, reducing the effect on carbon emissions, costs, and time schedules. All dimensions (i.e. 6D) can be updated and re-calculated in real time when cross-linked with inspections and condition monitoring, generating real-time digital twin driven solutions."

Digital twin-driven variant design of a 3C electronic product assembly line,Paper Metadata,Paper DOI,10.1038/s41598-022-07894-x  
Digital twin-driven variant design of a 3C electronic product assembly line,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,"Large-scale personalization is becoming a reality. To ensure market competitiveness and economic benefits, enterprises require rapid response capability and flexible manufacturing operations. However, variant design and production line reconfiguration are complicated because it involves the commissioning, replacement, and adaptive integration of equipment and remodification of control systems. Herein, a digital twin-driven production line variant design is presented. As a new technology, the digital twin can realize the parallel control from the physical world to the digital world and accelerate the design process of the production line through a virtual-real linkage. Simultaneously, the actual production line can be simulated to verify the rationality of the design scheme and avoid cost wastage. Four key technologies are described in detail, and a production line variant design platform based on digital twin is built to support rapid production line variant design. Finally, experiments using a smartphone assembly line as an example are performed; the results demonstrate that the proposed method can realize production line variant design and increase production efficiency.

Digital Twin-Empowered Network Planning for Multi-Tier Computing,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,"In this paper, we design a resource management scheme to support stateful applications, which will be prevalent in 6G networks. Different from stateless applications, stateful applications require context data while executing computing tasks from user terminals (UTs). Using a multi-tier computing paradigm with servers deployed at the core network, gateways, and base stations to support stateful applications, we aim to optimize long-term resource reservation by jointly minimizing the usage of computing, storage, and communication resources and the cost from reconfiguring resource reservation. The coupling among different resources and the impact of UT mobility create challenges in resource management. To address the challenges, we develop digital twin (DT) empowered network planning with two elements, i.e., multiresource reservation and resource reservation reconfiguration. First, DTs are designed for collecting UT status data, based on which UTs are grouped according to their mobility patterns. Second, an algorithm is proposed to customize resource reservation for different groups to satisfy their different resource demands. Last, a Meta-learning-based approach is developed to reconfigure resource reservation for balancing the network resource usage and the reconfiguration cost. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed DT-empowered network planning outperforms benchmark frameworks by using less resources and incurring lower reconfiguration costs."

Digital twinning of self-sensing structures using the statistical finite element method,Paper Metadata,Paper title,Digital twinning of self-sensing structures using the statistical finite element method
Digital twinning of self-sensing structures using the statistical finite element method,Paper Metadata,Paper DOI,10.1017/dce.2022.28
Digital twinning of self-sensing structures using the statistical finite element method,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,"The monitoring of infrastructure assets using sensor networks is becoming increasingly prevalent. A digital twin in the form of a finite element (FE) model, as commonly used in design and construction, can help make sense of the copious amount of collected sensor data. This paper demonstrates the application of the statistical finite element method (statFEM), which provides a principled means of synthesizing data and physics-based models, in developing a digital twin of a self-sensing structure. As a case study, an instrumented steel railway bridge of 27:34 m length located along the West Coast Mainline near Staffordshire in the UK is considered. Using strain data captured from fiber Bragg grating sensors at 108 locations along the bridge superstructure, statFEM can predict the ""true"" system response while taking into account the uncertainties in sensor readings, applied loading, and FE model misspecification errors. Longitudinal strain distributions along the two main I-beams are both measured and modeled during the passage of a passenger train. The statFEM digital twin is able to generate reasonable strain distribution predictions at locations where no measurement data are available, including at several points along the main I-beams and on structural elements on which sensors are not even installed. The implications for long-term structural health monitoring and assessment include optimization of sensor placement and performing more reliable what-if analyses at locations and under loading scenarios for which no measurement data are available."

Digital twin modeling method based on IFC standards for building construction processes,Paper Metadata,Paper title,Digital twin modeling method based on IFC standards for building construction processes  
Digital twin modeling method based on IFC standards for building construction processes,Paper Metadata,Paper DOI,10.3389/fenrg.2024.1334192  
Digital twin modeling method based on IFC standards for building construction processes,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,"Intelligent construction is a necessary way to improve the traditional construction method, and digital twin can be a crucial technology to promote intelligent construction. However, the construction field currently needs a unified method to build a standardized and universally applicable digital twin model, which is incredibly challenging in construction. Therefore, this paper proposes a general method to construct a digital twin construction process model based on the Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) standard, aiming to realize real-time monitoring, control, and visualization management of the construction site. The method constructs a digital twin fusion model from three levels: geometric model, resource model, and behavioral model by establishing an IFC semantic model of the construction process, storing the fusion model data and the construction site data into a database, and completing the dynamic interaction of the twin data in the database. At the same time, the digital twin platform is developed to realize the visualization and control of the construction site. Combined with practical cases and analysis, the implementation effect of the method is shown and verified. The results show that the method can adapt itself to different scenarios on the construction site, which is conducive to promoting application of the digital twin in the field of construction and provides a reference to the research of practicing digital twin theory and practice.

Digital Twins Development Architectures and Deployment Technologies: Moroccan use Case,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,"With the initiation of the fourth industrial revolution and the advent of information and communication technologies that reinforces the development of advanced technological solutions which engage data sciences, artificial intelligence, and cyber physical systems many long-established research concepts have been revived with in-depth applications within manufacturing plants. Thus currently the interest is turning more and more towards technologies and approaches that can combine between the virtual world and its increased capacities in computer sciences and processing, and the physical world with its complex systems and constantly evolving requirements. A relevant concept in this context is the concept of digital twins. Digital twins as defined by their founder Dr Michael Grieves are virtual replicas of a physical system that evolves within a virtual environment in order to mirror their real counterparts' life cycle and evolvement within the physical environment for applications in numerous domains. This paper's aim is to present a literature review of digital twin concept, its different development and deployment architectures, and its potential of application across Moroccan industrial ecosystems."

Digital Twins for Climate-Neutral and Resilient Cities. State of the Art and Future Development as Tools to Support Urban Decision-Making,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,"The increased effects of climate change in the built environment require a rapid and effective response to adapt urban settlements to the main impacts related to heatwave, extreme precipitation, sea-level rise, and so on. At the same time, there is not much time to reduce Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions that contribute to climate change and limit the mean temperature of the planet within the 1.5 °C imposed by the Paris Agreement. In this perspective, cities around the world have a key role toward carbon neutral and resilient targets. In parallel in the last years, we are witnessing the impacts of a big amount of data and information available at the city scale. There are many data coming from different databases that can be processed and managed to support the urban climate action planned and designed by decision-makers and urban practitioners, for example, to assess the carbon emission of the building sector or to simulate the effects of extreme precipitation or urban heat island and consequence behavior of the built environment. In this scenario, in the last years, among many different digital enable technologies available in the Industry 4.0 ambit, it has gained more attention in the field of urban planning and urban design the digital twin concept that could synthesize in a digital representation of the real-world data and information flow that could exchange from the physical side to digital representation and vice versa. The aim of the paper is to analyze the urban digital twin developed in last years in Europe to evaluate if and how they consider the climate change issue, in order to understand the state of the art, the applications developed for climate change and which is the level of experimentation in order to study and develop guidelines to build urban digital twin as a support tool for a climate-neutral and resilient city."

Digital twins for Decision making in complex proDuction anD logistic enterprises,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,"The operation and optimization of complex production and logistic enterprises requires modern, data and simulation driven multi criteria decision approaches. Digital enterprise systems are complex systems, in terms of layout variability, control strategies, business processes and system parameter. all of these aspects are not independent and even due to the system dynamics the optimal solution may differ depending on the actual situation applying specific requirements. in order to improve operative decision making in production and logistic enterprises a digital twin concept can be applied. these digital twins are virtual clones of real systems or subsystems. with simulation and artificial intelligence technologies new opportunities for operative decision making are possible. Digital twins can cover the entire lifecycle of an asset or process by forming a closed-loop chain for smart, connected products, services and production and logistic processes, from design to operation, from deployment to continuous improvement."

Digital twins for intelligent cities: the case study of Matera,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,"The digital twin (DT) paradigm provides a purpose-built digital representation of a physical system. DTs are often composed by several interconnected models, which need to be specifically tailored to fit the DT purposes. The objective of this work is the development of an urban digital twin (UDT) for the city of Matera, following urban intelligence (UI) paradigm. The latter leverages the multi-disciplinary integration and optimization of the city systems and subsystems to develop purpose-driven DTs and support the decision-making process. The UDT is intended to support governance, stakeholders, and citizens, integrating morphological data for the city representation, reliable simulation tools and data-driven methods for the city state prediction (e.g., traffic, solar irradiation), optimization algorithms for planning and emergency response, sensors for vehicle and pedestrian traffic volumes and environmental monitoring (e.g., pollutant distributions), and a participatory data collection process from the citizens. A Data Lake is used to make available to the UDT modules the data produced by the morphological representation, simulations/data-driven methods, sensors, and the participatory data. The Data Lake provides a standardized approach for the aggregation and extraction of information. Finally, an Urban Sensing Engine supports the decision-making process with artificial intelligence forms of reasoning, to effectively combine the information produced by the UDT components.  "

Digital Twin Placement for Minimum Application Request Delay With Data Age Targets,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,Digital Twins are softwarized mirrors of physical systems that represent their physical counterparts and reflect their behavior under different scenarios. This work addresses the problem of optimal digital twin placement on limited execution servers to minimize latency of application requests while maintaining data freshness (age of information) below thresholds. The problem is formulated as an integer quadratic program and approximated with polynomial-time algorithms balancing latency and data age targets.

Digital twin predicting diet response before and after long-term fasting,Paper Metadata,Paper DOI,10.1371/journal.pcbi.1010469
Digital twin predicting diet response before and after long-term fasting,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,"Today, there is great interest in diets proposing new combinations of macronutrient compositions and fasting schedules. Unfortunately, there is little consensus regarding the impact of these different diets, since available studies measure different sets of variables in different populations, thus only providing partial, non-connected insights. We lack an approach for integrating all such partial insights into a useful and interconnected big picture. Herein, we present such an integrating tool. The tool uses a novel mathematical model that describes mechanisms regulating diet response and fasting metabolic fluxes, both for organ-organ crosstalk, and inside the liver. The tool can mechanistically explain and integrate data from several clinical studies, and correctly predict new independent data, including data from a new study. Using this model, we can predict non-measured variables, e.g. hepatic glycogen and gluconeogenesis, in response to fasting and different diets. Furthermore, we exemplify how such metabolic responses can be successfully adapted to a specific individual's sex, weight, height, as well as to the individual's historical data on metabolite dynamics. This tool enables an offline digital twin technology."

"Digital twin simulation modeling, artificial intelligence-based Internet of Manufacturing Things systems, and virtual machine and cognitive computing algorithms in the Industry 4.0-based Slovak labor market ",Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,"Research background: On the basis of an analysis of the current situation and expectations in the field of implementation of the elements of the Industry 4.0 concept, the purpose of this paper is to identify the effects on the labor market in large manufacturing enterprises in the Slovak Republic. Purpose of the article: The presented work has a theoretical-empirical nature and consists of a theoretical section and a practical section, which includes statistical indicator analysis and quantitative research. In the theoretical section, the paper discusses the issue of Industry 4.0 in general, with a focus on its impact on the labor market, thus laying the groundwork for future research on the subject. Methods: The output of this work is an analysis of selected indicators of the manufacturing industry sector in the Slovak Republic, based on the most recent employment data analysis in the first stage and quantitative research survey in the second stage, with the respondents being manufacturing industry companies operating in the Slovak Republic, and whose primary objective is to determine the current status of the implementation of the elements and technologies of Industry 4.0 in production companies in the Slovak Republic, as well as the factors influencing this situation, such as digital twin simulation modeling, artificial intelligence-based Internet of Manufacturing Things systems, and virtual machine and cognitive computing algorithms. Findings & value added: The research findings indicate that the degree of digitization adopted by businesses in the Slovak Republic is comparatively less robust and more sluggish to adapt. This is primarily attributable to the underdeveloped educational system, population reluctance, self-actualization, and inadequate state support. Recommendations for the Slovak market aim to increase the digital proficiency of businesses and of the general populace through various means, such as reforming legislation, enhancing state support for entrepreneurs, and modifying the education system, constituting the added value of the work."

Digital twin simulation modelling shows that mass testing and local lockdowns effectively controlled COVID-19 in Denmark Check for updates,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,"Following the COVID-19 pandemic, it is important to evaluate different mitigation strategies for future preparedness. Mass testing and local lockdowns were employed during the Alpha wave in Denmark, which led to ten times more tests than the typical European member state and incidence-based restrictions at the parish level. This study aims to quantify the effects of these interventions in terms of hospital admissions and societal freedom. Methods This study assesses the effectiveness of these strategies via counterfactual scenarios using a detailed, individual-based simulation model that replicates the entire Danish population. The model considers multiple factors, including evolving societal restrictions, vaccination roll-out, seasonal influences, and varying intensities of PCR and antigen testing across different age groups and degree of completed vaccination. It also integrates adaptive human behavior in response to changes in incidences at the municipality and parish levels. Results The simulations show, that without mass testing in Denmark, there would have been a 150% increase in hospital admissions, and additional local lockdowns equivalent to 21 days of strict national lockdown. Without the policy of local lockdowns, hospitalizations would have increased by 50%. Conclusions In conclusion, the combination of mass testing and local lockdowns likely prevented a large increase in hospitalizations while increasing overall societal freedom during the Alpha wave in Denmark. In future epidemics, mass testing and local lockdowns can likely prevent overwhelming healthcare systems in phases of high transmission and hospitalization risks."

Digital twin data-driven proactive job-shop scheduling strategy towards asymmetric manufacturing execution decision,Paper Metadata,Paper DOI,10.1038/s41598-022-05304-w
Digital twin data-driven proactive job-shop scheduling strategy towards asymmetric manufacturing execution decision,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,"The information asymmetry phenomenon widely exists in production management decisions due to the latency of manufacturing data transmissions. Also, stochastic events on the physical production site will result in information asymmetry, which may lead to inconsistency between current execution and previous resource allocation plans. It is meaningful and important for developing an information model based on the Internet of Manufacturing Things to timely and actively adjust the scheduling strategy to meet the symmetry requirements of the production execution process. Based on the digital twin data collected from the workshop, a proactive job-shop scheduling strategy was discussed in this paper. Firstly, the mechanism for the influence of delayed local operations on makespan was deduced. Then, a framework for implementing the proactive job-shop scheduling strategy was proposed. Coordination point was used to determine the adjustment interval of local operations; right-shift rule with delay time constraints was used to adjust the unprocessed operation sequences on machines. Finally, the examples including 6*6 (6 jobs, 6 machines) and 20*40 (20 jobs, 40 machines) were presented to verify the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed method. It can be predicted that the proactive scheduling strategy provides the online decisions for the efficient and smooth execution of the digital twin-driven workshop production."

Digital Twin for Sustainability Evaluation of Railway Station Buildings,Paper Metadata,Paper DOI,10.3389/fbuil.2018.00077  
Digital Twin for Sustainability Evaluation of Railway Station Buildings,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,"The railway station is a primary asset of public transport systems and plays a crucial role in urban modernization. Most existing railway stations in the UK is historic and have been operated for many years. Maintenance and reconstruction are common concerns in the public railway industry, and clusters of information pertaining to this maintenance must be managed appropriately for effective outcome. Digital twin or BIM (Building information modeling) is a term frequently employed in the construction industry nowadays, because of its ability to provide wider and faster access to comprehensible and integrated information. A digital twin or a BIM is not only a tool, but also a process that can help to make changes in construction industry, which has remained unchanged for hundreds of years. This paper discusses a specific BIM application within the context of railway station buildings using a Revit-based simulation of construction work for King's Cross station in London. The paper highlights the adoption and transformation of 3D model of the King's Cross station building into a 6D building information model. The 6D model contains a time and cost schedule with carbon emissions calculation, and renovation assumptions using Revit. The outcome of this study can provide construction participants with reasonable guidance of BIM adoption on railway station projects that can be used for planning, designing, and operating an economic and environmental efficient construction project.

Digital Twins for More Precise and Personalized Treatment,Paper Metadata,Paper title,Digital Twins for More Precise and Personalized Treatment
Digital Twins for More Precise and Personalized Treatment,Paper Metadata,Paper DOI,10.3233/SHTI230961
Digital Twins for More Precise and Personalized Treatment,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,"The use of Digital Twins (DTs) or the digital replicas of physical entities has provided benefits to several industry sectors, most notably manufacturing. To date, the application of DTs in the healthcare sector has been minimal, however. But, as pressure increases for more precise and personalized treatments, it behooves us to investigate the potential for DTs in the healthcare context. As a proof-of-concept demonstration prior to working with real patients, we attempt in this paper, to explore the potential for creating and using DTs. We do this in a synthetic environment at this stage, making use of data that is all computer-generated. DTs of synthetic present patients are created making use of data of synthetic past patients. In the real world, the clinical objective for creating such DTs of real patients would be to enable enhanced real-time clinical decision support to enable more precise and personalized care. The objective of the numerical experiment reported in this paper, is to envisage the possibilities and challenges of such an approach. We attempt to better understand the strengths and weaknesses of applying DTs in the healthcare context to support more precise and personalized treatments."

Digital Twin for UAV (Parrot ARDrone 2.0) in Industry 4.0 Manufacturing Systems,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,"Complex Manufacturing Systems can be better engineered with simulation techniques Relaying only on physical system to collect real world and capturing models is out of date. Moreover, a complex system has recursive model design, which leads to consume more time and more maintenance, unplanned down times and poor operating efficiency. The New Industry 4.0 digital twin creates virtual mirror of actual system. Here we have demonstrated digital twinning of UAV(Parrot ARDrone 2.0). Digital twin is virtual replica of physical assets and it can be simulated with real time data using industrial Internet of Things. Simulation with real time data improves operating efficiency, reduces unplanned down time hence increased revenue to manufactures."

Digital Twins for Smart Home Gadget Threat Prediction using Deep Convolution Neural Network,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,"Digital twin is one of the most important innovations in the Internet of Things (IoT) era and business disruption. Digital twins are a growing technology that bridges the gap between the real and the digital. Home automation in the IoT refers to the practice of automatically managing and monitoring smart home electronics by use of a variety of control system methods. The geysers, refrigerators, fans, lighting, fire alarms, kitchen timers, and other electrical and electronic items in the home can all be managed and monitored with the help of a variety of control methods. Digital twins replicate the physical machine in real time and produce data, such as asset degradation, product performance level that may be used by the predictive maintenance algorithm to identify the product functionality levels. The purpose of this research is to design the framework of Digital Twin using machine learning and state estimation algorithms model to assess and predict home appliances based on the probability rate of smart home system gadgets functionality. The main goal of this research is to create a digital twin for smart home gadgets that are used to monitor the health status of these devices for increasing the life time and to reduce maintenance costs. This research presents a Deep Convolution Neural Network based Logistic Regression Model with Digital Twins (DCNN-LR-DT) for accurate prediction of smart home gadget functionality levels and to predict the threats in advance. The proposed model is compared with the traditional models and the results represent that the proposed model performance is better than traditional models."

Digital twins for the rapid startup of manufacturing processes: a case study in PVC tube extrusion,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,"In this work, a soft sensor-based digital twin (DT) was developed to reduce the startup time in manufacturing plastic tubes and enable real-time product quality monitoring, i.e., the weight per unit length and the inner and outer diameters of the tube. An experimental campaign was conducted on a real tube extrusion line using three polyvinyl chloride (PVC) compounds and different process conditions, and machine learning regression algorithms were trained and tested to create the models of the extruder and the extrusion die the DT is based on. The characterization of the considered material, whose properties were given as input to the digital models, was carried out according to a procedure based only on the data collected by the production line. The DT was tested for the startup of the production of a single-layer tube and allowed to achieve the specified customer requirements (thickness and weight) in a few minutes. The proposed solution thus proved to be a valuable tool for reducing the setup time, thus increasing the efficiency of the process."

Digital twins of organization: implications for organization design,Paper Metadata,Paper DOI,10.1007/s41469-023-00151-z
Digital twins of organization: implications for organization design,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,"The recent rise of using digital representations for products and processes has created a movement to use 'digital twins' for organization design. We provide an overview of the notion of digital twin as a synchronized, real-time two-way interacting digital representation of the real-world phenomenon it is expected to replicate as a twin. The claim of a two-way causal connection between the real-world and the digital representation makes the current rhetoric about Digital Twins especially problematic. To grasp the challenges involved in Digital Twins of Organizations (DTO), we start from Digital Twins of Things (DTT) and Digital Twins of Business Processes (DTBP). We analyze and compare different kinds of digital twins using Peircean theory of semiotic relationships, which differentiate between signals, icons, and symbols. We posit that in order to fully model organizations as digital twins, an organization designer needs to model features of organizations that are not present in DTTs and DTBPs, such as agency, conflict, and emergence. Given the inevitable presence of symbolic phenomena, we speculate to what extent it is possible to move towards full DTOs, what characteristics broader DTOs need to have, and what benefits more extensive use of DTOs will offer for organization designers. We finally offer pointers towards a research agenda for DTOs that have the potential to improve organization designs and contribute to theory on organization design."

Digital Twins of Stone Masonry Buildings for Damage Assessment,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,"Digital twins are virtual models of physical objects or systems that enable real-time monitoring and analysis. In the field of stone masonry buildings, digital twins can be used to assess damage, predict maintenance needs, and optimize building performance. However, creating and analyzing digital twins of stone masonry buildings can be a complex and time-consuming process that requires specialized skills and equipment. In this paper, we present various methodologies for the generation of damage augmented digital twins (DADTs) of stone masonry buildings that involve the use of machine learning and computer vision techniques to automate the process. These methodologies include crack segmentation using convolutional neural networks, crack characterization using machine learning, automatic generation of simplified geometries of buildings, generation of DADTs containing geometrical and damage information, generation of finite element models for stone masonry buildings, and geometrical digital twins for stone masonry elements for numerical modeling. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these methodologies using a variety of datasets and show that they can significantly improve the accuracy and speed of damage assessment compared to traditional methods. Our work contributes to the development of a framework for real-time damage assessment of stone masonry buildings and lays the foundation for future research in this area."

Digital Twin and Deep Reinforcement Learning-Driven Robotic Automation System for Confined Workspaces: A Nozzle Dam Replacement Case Study in Nuclear Power Plants,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,"Robotic automation has emerged as a leading solution for replacing human workers in dirty, dangerous, and demanding industries to ensure the safety of human workers. However, practical implementation of this technology remains limited, requiring substantial effort and costs. This study addresses the challenges specific to nuclear power plants, characterized by hazardous environments and physically demanding tasks such as nozzle dam replacement in confined workspaces. We propose a digital twin and deep-reinforcement-learning-driven robotic automation system with an autonomous mobile manipulator. The study follows a four-step process. First, we establish a simplified testbed for a nozzle dam replacement task and implement a high-fidelity digital twin model of the real-world testbed. Second, we employ a hybrid visual perception system that combines deep object pose estimation and an iterative closest point algorithm to enhance the accuracy of the six-dimensional pose estimation. Third, we use a deep-reinforcement-learning method, particularly the proximal policy optimization algorithm with inverse reachability map, and a centroidal waypoint strategy, to improve the controllability of an autonomous mobile manipulator. Finally, we conduct pre-performed simulations of the nozzle dam replacement in the digital twin and evaluate the system on a robot in the real-world testbed. The nozzle dam replacement with precise object pose estimation, navigation, target object grasping, and collision-free motion generation was successful. The robotic automation system achieved a 92.0% success rate in the digital twin. Our proposed method can improve the efficiency and reliability of robotic automation systems for extreme workspaces and other perilous environments."

Construction Project Management with Digital Twin Information System,Paper Metadata,Paper DOI,10.46338/ijetae1022_03
Construction Project Management with Digital Twin Information System,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,"The current stage in the development of the construction industry is its digitalization, which requires the transformation of processes and models based on the use of digital platforms and twins. Datasets in a construction project accumulates quickly and becomes difficult to store and process due to the large file sizes of CAD,GIS and BIM technologies. Managing such datasets is a complex problem, since the usefulness of such data lies in ensuring that it is available and used as needed by all participants in a construction project. The article proposes to develop an information system for creating digital twins of construction project management as an integrator of digital tools based on Big Data Analytics and BIM technology, which is already the standard for the digitalization of the construction industry. The study describes four types of digital twins and ten properties of Big Data required for construction project. Conceptual model of Big Data domains for construction project and BIM-model of Big Data exchange and information transfer for construction project digital twin are considered. The authors propose a framework for creating digital twins of construction project management that uses three main components: BIM-models, Big Data Analytics and Knowledge Base. The results of the study are structure of information system of creating digital twin of territory urban planning project for Design Company and example using a BIMoriented software product."

Context awareness in process monitoring of additive manufacturing using a digital twin,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,"Wire Arc Additive Manufacturing allows the cost-effective manufacturing of customized, large-scale metal parts. As the post-process quality assurance of large parts is costly and time-consuming, process monitoring is inevitable. In the present study, a context-aware monitoring solution was investigated by integrating machine, temporal, and spatial context in the data analysis. By analyzing the voltage patterns of each cycle in the oscillating cold metal transfer process with a deep neural network, temporal context was included. Spatial context awareness was enabled by building a digital twin of the manufactured part using an Octree as spatial indexing data structure. By means of the spatial context awareness, two quality metrics-the defect expansion and the local anomaly density-were introduced. The defect expansion was tracked in-process by assigning detected defects to the same defect cluster in case of spatial correlation. The local anomaly density was derived by defining a spherical region of interest which enabled the detection of aggregations of anomalies. By means of the context aware monitoring system, defects were detected in-process with a higher sensitivity as common defect detectors for welding applications, showing less false-positives and false-negatives. A quantitative evaluation of defect expansion and densities of various defect types such as pore nests was enabled."

Continuous Evolution of Digital Twins using the DarTwin Notation,Paper Metadata,Paper title,Continuous Evolution of Digital Twins using the DarTwin Notation
Continuous Evolution of Digital Twins using the DarTwin Notation,Paper Metadata,Paper DOI,10.1007/s10270-024-01216-7
Continuous Evolution of Digital Twins using the DarTwin Notation,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,"Despite best efforts, various challenges remain in the creation and maintenance processes of digital twins (DTs). One of those primary challenges is the constant, continuous and omnipresent evolution of systems, their user's needs and their environment, demanding the adaptation of the developed DT systems. DTs are developed for a specific purpose, which generally entails the monitoring, analysis, simulation or optimisation of a specific aspect of an actual system, referred to as the actual twin (AT). As such, when the twin system changes, that is either the AT itself changes, or the scope/purpose of a DT is modified, the DTs usually evolve in close synchronicity with the AT. As DTs are software systems, the best practices or methodologies for software evolution can be leveraged. This paper tackles the challenge of maintaining a (set of) DT(s) throughout the evolution of the user's requirements and priorities and tries to understand how this evolution takes place. In doing so, we provide two contributions: (i) we develop DarTwin, a visual notation form that enables reasoning on a twin system, its purposes, properties and implementation, and (ii) we introduce a set of architectural transformations that describe the evolution of DT systems. The development of these transformations is driven and illustrated by the evolution and transformations of a family home's DT, whose purpose is expanded, changed and re-prioritised throughout its ongoing lifecycle. Additionally, we evaluate the transformations on a laboratory-scale gantry crane's DT."

Process-Structure-Property Relationship of Lightweight Metallic Materials Correlation of digital twin and roll surface sensor results for AZ31 alloy TRC process,Paper Metadata,Paper DOI,10.1007/s10853-024-09733-y
Process-Structure-Property Relationship of Lightweight Metallic Materials Correlation of digital twin and roll surface sensor results for AZ31 alloy TRC process,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,"Due to the growing interest in lightweight constructions, the continuous casting of nonferrous metals is continuously developing as a result of the cost-effectiveness of this process, which combines several stages of sheet production. Unfortunately, because of the characteristics of the process, the parameters in the roll gap, such as, for example, pressure and temperature, are unknown, significantly affects the understanding of the phenomena occurring in the material during rolling. Therefore, at IMF Freiberg, a sensor consisting of a piezo sensor and two thermocouples measuring the temperature at two different heights was mounted on the surface of the roll, making it possible to control the process parameters live during the TRC trial. The measurements were further supported by a digital twin in the form of a layer model, combining a viscous and solid region for each layer in a single tool. The computations in this tool are performed offline and the computation time is in the order of seconds, thus much less than that of the finite element method. Because the layer model measures the temperature of the magnesium strip, FEM simulations were used to validate measurements from thermocouples. Experimental results have been obtained that allow for a direct correlation between the development of the pressure and temperature and the length of the fully solidified L D part in the roll gap zone, which correlates directly with the effective total equivalent strain. Using the sensor and layer model, it is possible to train a digital twin that can be used for online estimation of the final strip properties obtained in the TRC process."

Cultural heritage digital twin: modeling and representing the visual narrative in Leonardo Da Vinci's Mona Lisa,Paper Metadata,Paper title,Cultural heritage digital twin: modeling and representing the visual narrative in Leonardo Da Vinci's Mona Lisa
Cultural heritage digital twin: modeling and representing the visual narrative in Leonardo Da Vinci's Mona Lisa,Paper Metadata,Paper DOI,10.1007/s00521-024-10010-x
Cultural heritage digital twin: modeling and representing the visual narrative in Leonardo Da Vinci's Mona Lisa,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,"In this paper, Artificial Intelligence/Knowledge Representation methods are used for the digital modeling of cultural heritage elements. Accordingly, the new concept of digital cultural heritage twin is presented as composed of a physical component and an immaterial component of the cultural entity. The former concerns the physical aspects, i.e. style, name of the artist, execution time, dimension, etc. The latter represents the emotional and intangible aspects transmitted by the entity, i.e. emotions, thoughts, opinions. In order to digitally model the physical and immaterial components of the twin, the Narrative Knowledge Representation Language has been formally introduced and described. It is particularly suitable for representing the immaterial aspects of the cultural entity, as it is capable of modeling in a simple but rigorous and efficient way complex situations and events, behaviours, attitudes, etc. As an experiment, NKRL has been adopted for representing some of the most relevant intangible items of the visual narrative underlying the hidden painting that lies beneath the Mona Lisa (La Gioconda) image painted by Leonardo Da Vinci on the same poplar panel. Real-time application of the resulting knowledge base opens up novel possibilities for the development of virtual objects, chatbots and expert systems, as well as the definition of semantic search platforms related to cultural heritage."

Customizable and Robust Internet of Robots Based on Network Slicing and Digital Twin,Paper Metadata,Paper DOI,10.1109/MNET.2024.3375503
Customizable and Robust Internet of Robots Based on Network Slicing and Digital Twin,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,"The Internet of Robots (IoR) is proficient in handling complex tasks in challenging environments, yet it encounters challenges related to service and scenario diversity, risk reduction, and ultra-low latency requirements. To address these challenges, we propose an integrated architecture that enhances the IoR's adaptability, flexibility, robustness, and low latency. This is achieved through the introduction of network slicing, service-based architecture, and digital twin (DT). We have developed an open-source experimental platform to showcase the customizability of the proposed architecture. Slices with different requirements are set up in WiFi and cellular scenarios to demonstrate its versatility. Additionally, we present a DT-assisted deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach for the IoR to improve DRL performance and mitigate risks associated with undesirable actions. The DT is employed to predict rewards and dynamic state transitions in the physical environment. Furthermore, we introduce a resource allocation method that combines data processing queue preemption and spectrum puncturing. This is designed to accommodate coexisting services, specifically enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) and bursty ultra-reliable low latency communications (URLLC). Experimental and numerical results validate the effectiveness of our proposed methods, showing improvements in customizability, robustness, latency, and outage probability in IoR."

CYBERSECURITY FOR DIGITAL TWINS IN THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT: CURRENT RESEARCH AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,"Recent technological developments in the construction industry are seeking to create smart cities by using Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) to enhance information models such as BIM. Currently, BIM models are commonly adopted to work with IoT-based systems and embrace smart technologies that offer interoperability in the communication layer. In future, it is envisioned that digital twins will provide new possibilities for cyberphysical systems via monitoring and simulation. However, rarely in this rapidly developing field is security fully considered. This paper reviews the relevant literature regarding the use of the IoT in the built environment and analyses current practices. It also presents examples of cities that use the IoT to improve construction and the lived experience. Finally, it reviews how digital twins factor in multiple layers defined in CPSs, from physical objects to information models. Based on this review, recommendations are provided documenting how BIM specifications can be expanded to become IoT compliant, enhancing standards to support cybersecurity, and ensuring digital twin and city standards can be fully integrated in future secure smart cities."

A real-time digital twin for active safety in an aircraft hangar,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,"The aerospace industry prioritises safety protocols to prevent accidents that can result in injuries, fatalities, or aircraft damage. One of the potential hazards that can occur while manoeuvring aircraft in and out of a hangar is collisions with other aircraft or buildings, which can lead to operational disruption and costly repairs. To tackle this issue, we have developed the Smart Hangar project, which aims to alert personnel of increased risks and prevent incidents from happening. The Smart Hangar project uses computer vision, LiDAR, and ultra-wideband sensors to track all objects and individuals within the hangar space. These data inputs are combined to form a real-time 3D Digital Twin (DT) of the hangar environment. The Active Safety system then uses the DT to perform real-time path planning, collision prediction, and safety alerts for tow truck drivers and hangar personnel. This paper provides a detailed overview of the system architecture, including the technologies used, and highlights the system's performance. By implementing this system, we aim to reduce the risk of accidents in the aerospace industry and increase safety for all personnel involved. Additionally, we identify future research directions for the Smart Hangar project.  "

A Self-Healing and Fault-Tolerant Cloud-based Digital Twin Processing Management Model,Paper Metadata,Paper DOI,A Self-Healing and Fault-Tolerant Cloud-Based Digital Twin Processing Management Model.grobid
A Self-Healing and Fault-Tolerant Cloud-based Digital Twin Processing Management Model,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,"Digital twins, integral to cloud platforms, bridge physical and virtual worlds, fostering collaboration among stakeholders in manufacturing and processing. However, the cloud platforms face challenges like service outages, vulnerabilities, and resource contention, hindering critical digital twin application development. The existing research works have limited focus on reliability and fault tolerance in digital twin processing. In this context, this paper proposed a novel Self-healing and Faulttolerant cloud-based Digital Twin processing Management (SF-DTM) model. It employs collaborative digital twin tasks resource requirement estimation unit which utilizes newly devised Federated learning with cosine Similarity integration (SimiFed). Further, SF-DTM incorporates a self-healing fault-tolerance strategy employing a frequent sequence fault-prone pattern analytics unit for deciding the most admissible VM allocation. The implementation and evaluation of SF-DTM model using real traces demonstrates its effectiveness and resilience, revealing improved availability, higher Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF), and lower Mean Time To Repair (MTTR) compared with non-SF-DTM approaches, enhancing collaborative DT application management. SF-DTM improved the services availability up to 13.2% over non-SF-DTM-based DT processing."

A simulation based digital twin approach to assessing the organization of response to emergency calls Check for updates,Paper Metadata,Paper DOI,10.1038/s41746-024-01392-2
A simulation based digital twin approach to assessing the organization of response to emergency calls Check for updates,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,"In emergency situations, timely contact with emergency medical communication centers (EMCCs) is critical for patient outcomes. Increasing call volumes and economic constraints are challenging many countries, necessitating organizational changes in EMCCs. This study uses a simulation-based digital twin approach, creating a virtual model of EMCC operations to assess the impact of different organizational scenarios on accessibility. Specifically, we explore two decompartmentalized scenarios where traditionally isolated call centers are reorganized to enable more flexible call distribution. The primary measure of accessibility was service quality within 30 s of call reception. Our results show that decompartmentalization improves service quality by 17% to 21%. This study demonstrates that reducing regional isolation in EMCCs can enhance performance and accessibility with a simulation-based digital twin approach providing a clear and objective method to quantify the benefits."

A sink hole and caves caused by earth balance shield and digital twin observational method to control face stability,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,A sink hole was found at ground surface in a residential area in Tokyo in October 2020. The site was above a construction line of earth pressure balance shield tunnel with16.1 m in diameter and the crown at the depth of GL-47m. Further study revealed the dense sand layer above the tunnel has been loosened along the tunnel for about 200m length from the tunnel face. 3DFEM simulation based upon the site conditions showed a possibility of the loosing stability of the face when the ground is dense sand with little fine component. A digital twin observational method is proposed to discuss the face stability and to keep digging safe.

A Smart Decision Making System for the Optimization of Manufacturing Systems Maintenance using Digital Twins and Ontologies,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,"Now-a-days manufacturing processes are becoming more and more complex which constantly complicate the management of their life cycle. Although, in order to survive and maintain a good position in the competitive industrial context, industrials have understood that they must optimize the whole life cycle of their manufacturing processes. The maintenance constitutes one of the key processes indispensable to ensure the proper functioning and to optimize the lifetime of machines and production lines, and thus to optimize quality and production costs. Therefore, its automation and optimization represent until now a center of interest for researches and manufacturers, especially those related to the integration of artificial intelligence tools in the industry. In this context, several new concepts and technologies have emerged, particularly in the context of industry 4.0. One of these new concepts is digital twins, which has become a promising direction to optimize manufacturing processes lifecycle. However, the implementation of this technology faces several complex problems related to the interoperability between physical entities and their virtual counterparts, as well as to the logical reasoning between the different elements constituting the digital twin. It is in this context that an approach based on digital twins and ontologies is proposed. The originality of this paper lies in two important points: the first is the exploitation of the expressiveness and reasoning capabilities of ontologies to solve cyber-physical interoperability problems at the digital twin level, while the second is the automation of the whole maintenance process and its decision making key points using the inference potentialities of ontologies. The applicability and effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated through an industrial case of study."

A virtual commissioning based methodology to integrate digital twins into manufacturing systems,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,"Digital Twin (DT) is considered a key approach to enhance the system reactivity to uncertain events due to its ability to getting data from the field and triggering actions on the physical asset. Given the modern technological and rapidly changing work environment, it is likely that in the next years companies will need to retrofit their manufacturing systems by integrating DTs. In this context, it is fundamental to define the necessary steps for the development of DTs and for their integration into manufacturing systems through a DT architecture. In response to this issue, a methodology based on Virtual Commissioning is proposed. A stepwise approach is illustrated in which the DT is designed, integrated and verified using a virtual environment. The methodology is validated through the integration of a DT into a flow shop for the implementation of a scheduling reactive to machine breakdown. By following the steps of the proposed methodology, a DT architecture able to improve the makespan of the studied flow shop is developed, suggesting the potential applicability of the approach to industrial manufacturing systems."

ABWOA: adaptive boundary whale optimization algorithm for large-scale digital twin network construction,Paper Metadata,Paper DOI,10.1186/s13677-024-00667-z
ABWOA: adaptive boundary whale optimization algorithm for large-scale digital twin network construction,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,"Digital twin network (DTN) as an emerging network paradigm, have garnered growing attention. For large-scale networks, a crucial problem is how to effectively map physical networks onto the infrastructure platform of DTN. To address this issue, we propose a heuristic method of the adaptive boundary whale optimization algorithm (ABWOA) to solve the digital twin network construction problem, improving the efficiency and reducing operational costs of DTN. Extensive comparison experiments are conducted between ABWOA and various algorithms such as genetic algorithm, particle swarm optimization, artificial bee colony, differential evolution algorithm, moth search algorithm and original whale optimization algorithm. The experimental results show that ABWOA is superior to other algorithms in terms of solution quality, convergence speed, and time cost. It can solve the digital twin network construction problem more effectively."

ACT-R based human digital twin to enhance operators' performance in process industries,Paper Metadata,Paper title,ACT-R based human digital twin to enhance operators' performance in process industries  
ACT-R based human digital twin to enhance operators' performance in process industries,Paper Metadata,Paper DOI,10.3389/fnhum.2023.1038060  
ACT-R based human digital twin to enhance operators' performance in process industries,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,"To ensure safe and efficient operation, operators in process industries have to make timely decisions based on time-varying information. A holistic assessment of operators' performance is, therefore, challenging. Current approaches to operator performance assessment are subjective and ignore operators' cognitive behavior. In addition, these cannot be used to predict operators' expected responses during novel situations that may arise during plant operations. The present study seeks to develop a human digital twin (HDT) that can simulate a control room operator's behavior, even during various abnormal situations. The HDT has been developed using the ACT-R (Adaptive Control of Thought-Rational) cognitive architecture. It mimics a human operator as they monitor the process and intervene during abnormal situations. We conducted 426 trials to test the HDT's ability to handle disturbance rejection tasks. In these simulations, we varied the reward and penalty parameters to provide feedback to the HDT. We validated the HDT using the eye gaze behavior of 10 human subjects who completed 110 similar disturbance rejection tasks as that of the HDT. The results indicate that the HDT exhibits similar gaze behaviors as the human subjects, even when dealing with abnormal situations. These indicate that the HDT's cognitive capabilities are comparable to those of human operators. As possible applications, the proposed HDT can be used to generate a large database of human behavior during abnormalities which can then be used to spot and rectify flaws in novice operator's mental models. Additionally, the HDT can also enhance operators' decision-making during real-time operation.  "

Adaptive Device-Edge Collaboration on DNN Inference in AIoT: A Digital Twin-Assisted Approach,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,"Device-edge collaboration on deep neural network (DNN) inference is a promising approach to efficiently utilizing network resources for supporting artificial intelligence of things (AIoT) applications. In this paper, we propose a novel digital twin (DT)-assisted approach to device-edge collaboration on DNN inference that determines whether and when to stop local inference at a device and upload the intermediate results to complete the inference on an edge server. Instead of determining the collaboration for each DNN inference task only upon its generation, multi-step decision-making is performed during the on-device inference to adapt to the dynamic computing workload status at the device and the edge server. To enhance the adaptivity, a DT is constructed to evaluate all potential offloading decisions for each DNN inference task, which provides augmented training data for a machine learning-assisted decision-making algorithm. Then, another DT is constructed to estimate the inference status at the device to avoid frequently fetching the status information from the device, thus reducing the signaling overhead. We also derive necessary conditions for optimal offloading decisions to reduce the offloading decision space. Simulation results demonstrate the outstanding performance of our DT-assisted approach in terms of balancing the tradeoff among inference accuracy, delay, and energy consumption."

A Proposal for a FAIR Management of 3D Data in Cultural Heritage: The Aldrovandi Digital Twin Case,Paper Metadata,Paper DOI,10.3724/2096-7004.di.2024
A Proposal for a FAIR Management of 3D Data in Cultural Heritage: The Aldrovandi Digital Twin Case,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,"In this article we analyse 3D models of cultural heritage with the aim of answering three main questions: what processes can be put in place to create a FAIR-by-design digital twin of a temporary exhibition? What are the main challenges in applying FAIR principles to 3D data in cultural heritage studies and how are they different from other types of data (e.g. images) from a data management perspective? We begin with a comprehensive literature review touching on: FAIR principles applied to cultural heritage data; representation models; both Object Provenance Information (OPI) and Metadata Record Provenance Information (MRPI), respectively meant as, on the one hand, the detailed history and origin of an object, and -on the other hand -the detailed history and origin of the metadata itself, which describes the primary object (whether physical or digital); 3D models as cultural heritage research data and their creation, selection, publication, archival and preservation. We then describe the process of creating the Aldrovandi Digital Twin, by collecting, storing and modelling data about cultural heritage objects and processes. We detail the many steps from the acquisition of the Digital Cultural Heritage Objects (DCHO), through to the upload of the optimised."

Adsorbed Gas Storage Digital Twin,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,"One possibility for energy storage are fuels. With gaseous fuels like hydrogen or methane, significant efforts are necessary for a feasible storage in terms of compression or liquefaction. This is of particular importance in the mobility sector. An alternative to high-pressure or cryogenic gas storage is the storage by adsorption in porous media using nano-carbons, metal-organic frameworks, or metal hydrides as adsorbents. In order to assess the performance of the charging and discharging of adsorption tanks, the mass and energy balance as well as the phase equilibrium (adsorption isotherm) and, if present, the spatial distribution of properties has to be considered. In order to simplify the analysis and prediction of these models, an attempt is made to develop digital twins based on machine learning. Neural networks and Gaussian process regression are applied to replace the system of coupled nonlinear and differential equations. The data basis used is generated by simulations. Thus, it is possible to easily predict the performance of a storage tank for different gases or to determine an optimum storage device (material selection and tank design).  "

AI-enabled Cyber-Physical In-Orbit Factory -AI approaches based on digital twin technology for robotic small satellite production,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,"With the ever increasing number of active satellites in space, the rising demand for larger formations of small satellites and the commercialization of the space industry (so-called New Space), the realization of manufacturing processes in orbit comes closer to reality. Reducing launch costs and risks, allowing for faster on-demand deployment of individually configured satellites as well as the prospect for possible on-orbit servicing for satellites makes the idea of realizing an in-orbit factory promising. In this paper, we present a novel approach to an in-orbit factory of small satellites covering a digital process twin, AI-based fault detection, and teleoperated robot-control, which are being researched as part of the ""AI-enabled Cyber-Physical In-Orbit Factory"" project. In addition to the integration of modern automation and Industry 4.0 production approaches, the question of how artificial intelligence (AI) and learning approaches can be used to make the production process more robust, fault-tolerant and autonomous is addressed. This lays the foundation for a later realisation of satellite production in space in the form of an in-orbit factory. Central aspect is the development of a robotic AIT (Assembly, Integration and Testing) system where a small satellite could be assembled by a"

Anomaly detection in Skin Model Shapes using machine learning classifiers,Paper Metadata,Paper title,Anomaly detection in Skin Model Shapes using machine learning classifiers
Anomaly detection in Skin Model Shapes using machine learning classifiers,Paper Metadata,Paper DOI,10.1007/s00170-019-03794-z
Anomaly detection in Skin Model Shapes using machine learning classifiers,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,"The concept of Skin Model Shapes has been proposed as a method to generate digital twins of manufactured parts and is a new paradigm in the design and manufacturing industry. Skin Model Shapes use discrete surface representation schemes, such as meshes and point clouds, to represent surfaces, which makes them enablers to perform an accurate tolerance analysis and surface inspection. However, online inspection of manufactured parts through use of Skin Model Shapes has not been extensively studied. Moreover, the existing geometric variation inspection techniques do not detect unfamiliar changes within tolerance, which could be the precursors to the onset of the manufacturing of out of tolerance part. To detect the unfamiliar changes, as anomalies, and categorize them as systematic and random variations, some unique surface characteristics can be extracted and studied. Random surface deviations exhibit narrow normal distributions, and systematic deviations, on the other hand, exhibit wide, skewed, and multimodal distributions. Using those surface characteristics as key traits, machine learning classifiers can be used to classify deviations into systematic and random variations. To illustrate the method, multiple samples from a truck component manufacturing line were scanned and the collected 3D point cloud data was used to extract features. A prediction score of 97-100% can be achieved by decision tree, k-nearest neighbor, support vector machines, and ensemble classifiers. The purposed approach is expected to extend the existing online inspection approaches and applications of Skin Model Shapes in quality control."

Blockchain-secure patient Digital Twin in healthcare using smart contracts,Paper Metadata,Paper title,Blockchain-secure patient Digital Twin in healthcare using smart contracts
Blockchain-secure patient Digital Twin in healthcare using smart contracts,Paper Metadata,Paper DOI,10.1371/journal.pone.0286120
Blockchain-secure patient Digital Twin in healthcare using smart contracts,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,"Modern healthcare has a sharp focus on data aggregation and processing technologies. Consequently, from a data perspective, a patient may be regarded as a timestamped list of medical conditions and their corresponding corrective interventions. Technologies to securely aggregate and access data for individual patients in the quest for precision medicine have led to the adoption of Digital Twins in healthcare. Digital Twins are used in manufacturing and engineering to produce digital models of physical objects that capture the essence of device operation to enable and drive optimization. Thus, a patient's Digital Twin can significantly improve health data sharing. However, creating the Digital Twin from multiple data sources, such as the patient's electronic medical records (EMR) and personal health records (PHR) from wearable devices, presents some risks to the security of the model and the patient. The constituent data for the Digital Twin should be accessible only with permission from relevant entities and thus requires authentication, privacy, and provable provenance. This paper proposes a blockchain-secure patient Digital Twin that relies on smart contracts to automate the updating and communication processes that maintain the Digital Twin. The smart contracts govern the response the Digital Twin provides when queried, based on policies created for each patient. We highlight four research points: access control, interaction, privacy, and security of the Digital Twin and we evaluate the Digital Twin in terms of latency in the network, smart contract execution times, and data storage costs."

Circular Economy Advances with Artificial Intelligence and Digital Twin: Multiple-Case Study of Chinese Industries in Agriculture,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,"The population growth is drastically surging in demand for food and water and uplifting consumption and waste resulting in overburden of society and the environment. Urgent actions are required to address these emerging global issues. Therefore, adopting a circular economy (CE) is essential to sustain the consumption rate and accommodate the ever-increasing demand. Moreover, the CE practices accelerate the progress on sustainable development. From this perspective, digital technologies are playing driving roles in the successful implementations of CE practices and achievements of the United Nations' (UN) sustainable development goals (SDGs). Among various emerging digital technologies, artificial intelligence (AI) and digital twin ((DT) are the promising ones. This paper aims to understand and explore how both technologies facilitate the CE transitions and attain SDGs in the agriculture domain. To this end, we provide insights into the concepts of CE, AI, and DT with preliminary and current research status. This research evaluates the contributions of global organizations for CE transitions. We elaborate on the significant contributions of AI and DT in the transition towards CE and identify some challenges that hinder the adoption of these technologies. Besides expanding knowledge, concise multiple case studies are also presented as evidence to depict how companies in China are deploying these technologies to digitize various operations and create solutions for waste management, sustainable resource consumption, renewal energy, water conservation, etc. Findings reveal that these companies successfully attain many SDGs of 1, 2, 6, 7, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, and 17.  This paper enormously contributes to the emerging research domain of integrating CE, AI, DT, and agriculture."

Compliance and feedback based model to measure cloud trustworthiness for hosting digital twins,Paper Metadata,Paper DOI,10.1186/s13677-024-00690-0
Compliance and feedback based model to measure cloud trustworthiness for hosting digital twins,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,"Cloud-based digital twins use real-time data from various data sources to simulate the behavior and performance of their physical counterparts, enabling monitoring and analysis. However, one restraining factor in the use of cloud computing for digital twins is its users' concerns about the security of their data. This data may be located anywhere in the cloud, with very limited control of the user to ensure its security. Cloud-based digital twins provide opportunities for researchers to collaborate yet security of such digital twins requires measures specific to cloud computing. To overcome this shortcoming, we need to devise a mechanism that not only ensures essential security safeguards but also computes a Trustworthiness value for Cloud Service Providers (CSP). This would give confidence to cloud users and enable them to choose the right CSP for their data-related interaction. This research proposes a solution, whereby the Trustworthiness of CSPs is calculated based on their Compliance with data security controls, User Feedback, and Auditor Rating. Two additional factors, Accuracy of Compliance Measurement and Control Significance Factor have been built in, to cater for other nonstandard conditions. Our implementation of Data Security Compliance Monitor and Data Trust as a Service, along with three CSPs, each with ten different settings, has supported our proposition through the devised formula. Experimental outcomes show changes in the trustworthiness value with changes in compliance level, user feedback and auditor rating. CSPs with better compliance have better trustworthiness values. However, if the Accuracy of Compliance Measurement and Control Significance Factor are low the trustworthiness is also proportionately less. This creates a balance and realism in our calculations. This model is unique and will help in creating users' trust in cloud-based digital twins."

Adaptive Impact Factor Research Concerning Effectiveness of the Introduction and use of Digital Twins for Oil and Gas Deposits,Paper Metadata,Paper DOI,10.6000/1929-4409.2020.09.239
Adaptive Impact Factor Research Concerning Effectiveness of the Introduction and use of Digital Twins for Oil and Gas Deposits,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,"In recent years, there have been significant changes in the conditions of oil production leading to an increase in its cost and wasteful use of resources. This necessitates the search for a system of adaptive factors that can adapt to environmental changes, affect the cost reduction and increase in the efficiency of oil and gas fields. Studies show that this problem needs to be solved on the basis of the creation of digital oil or gas fields being digital counterparts of existing enterprises, which allow preserving nature and use resources economically due to the existing field development at a new qualitative level. However, the transformation of existing fields through their transformation into digital oil or gas fields requires serious justification, and above all, from a financial and economic points of view. At the same time, one should in no case ignore the natural factor contributing to saving, restoring the used oil and gas resources and preserving the external space being the human environment. The purpose of this study is to develop recommendations for assessing the economic efficiency of the implementation of the project concerning a digital oil or gas field being a digital twin of oil or gas enterprise, and their use in practice. Such an assessment will be carried out based on the analysis of the ratio between capital investments and operating costs necessary to create a digital oil or gas field, as well as by comparing the expected costs and benefits derived from its use."

Advances and utility of digital twins in critical care and acute care medicine: a narrative review,Paper Metadata,Paper DOI,10.12701/jyms.2024.01053
Advances and utility of digital twins in critical care and acute care medicine: a narrative review,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,"Accurate detection, differentiation, and characterization of both neoplastic and non-neoplastic colon polyps, with an average accuracy rate of 91.5%. Critical care is one of the most data-rich areas of healthcare and one of the largest areas where AI-related technologies can find fertile soil to grow and iteratively refine at a swift pace. However, introducing these innovations in settings where patients are critically ill or in life-or-death situations can be challenging. As discussions continue to intensify, providing an exploratory overview on the implementation and impact of DT technology has become increasingly relevant. By examining the role of DTs in critical care, we aim to provide an overview of how this innovative approach is transforming patient care and medical research."

AI-Driven Predictive Maintenance for Smart Manufacturing Systems Using Digital Twin Technology,Paper Metadata,Paper title,AI-Driven Predictive Maintenance for Smart Manufacturing Systems Using Digital Twin Technology
AI-Driven Predictive Maintenance for Smart Manufacturing Systems Using Digital Twin Technology,Paper Metadata,Paper DOI,10.22399/ijcesen.1099
AI-Driven Predictive Maintenance for Smart Manufacturing Systems Using Digital Twin Technology,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,"The rapid advancements in Industry 4.0 and smart manufacturing systems have necessitated the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Digital Twin Technology (DTT) to enhance operational efficiency and predictive maintenance strategies. This study proposes an AI-driven predictive maintenance framework that leverages Digital Twin Technology to enable real-time monitoring, fault diagnosis, and failure prediction in industrial environments. The framework integrates machine learning (ML) models, deep learning techniques, and edge computing to analyze sensor data, detect anomalies, and optimize maintenance schedules. A reinforcement learning-based decision model is employed to dynamically adjust maintenance strategies, reducing downtime and extending equipment lifespan. Additionally, physics-informed AI models are incorporated into the digital twin architecture to simulate operational behaviours and predict potential failures with high accuracy. The proposed system is validated through a case study in a smart manufacturing plant, demonstrating a 35% improvement in predictive accuracy, 40% reduction in unplanned downtimes, and 25% optimization in maintenance costs compared to traditional predictive maintenance approaches. The findings indicate that the integration of AI and DTT significantly enhances the reliability and efficiency of cyber-physical manufacturing systems (CPMS), paving the way for more autonomous and intelligent industrial operations."

14 Model order reduction and digital twins,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,"We are currently facing a substantial transformation of our industrial world and the way our economics are organized. This transformation, known as digitalization, is driven by the systemic integration of information technology in all kinds of devices, machines, and factories such that new smart networks are formed and new smart products have the ability to monitor, to forecast, and to control their behavior. One of the fundamental pillars of digitalization is simulation technology, since it enables the new intelligence layer in the form of digital twins which mirror the physical systems into the digital world -also named by Gartner Inc. as a top technology trend for 2017 and 2018. Creating such intelligence layers over several domains and life cycle phases requires, among other challenges, technologies for transforming and reducing complex simulation models. Exactly for this task a key technology is model order reduction (MOR). However, MOR is not only a key technology within emerging digital twins but also helps to reduce simulation times in the existing everyday business of simulation engineers. This is especially important when for a simulation model a large number of evaluations are needed. Within this chapter we present use cases where MOR is a key enabler for the realization of digital services and the reduction of simulation times. Furthermore we outline the potential of MOR in the context of realizing the digital twin vision."

4D Structural root architecture modeling from digital twins by X-Ray Computed Tomography,Paper Metadata,Paper DOI,10.1186/s13007-021-00819-1
4D Structural root architecture modeling from digital twins by X-Ray Computed Tomography,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,"Breakthrough imaging technologies may challenge the plant phenotyping bottleneck regarding marker-assisted breeding and genetic mapping. In this context, X-Ray CT (computed tomography) technology can accurately obtain the digital twin of root system architecture (RSA) but computational methods to quantify RSA traits and analyze their changes over time are limited. RSA traits extremely affect agricultural productivity. We develop a spatial-temporal root architectural modeling method based on 4D data from X-ray CT. This novel approach is optimized for high-throughput phenotyping considering the cost-effective time to process the data and the accuracy and robustness of the results. Significant root architectural traits, including root elongation rate, number, length, growth angle, height, diameter, branching map, and volume of axial and lateral roots are extracted from the model based on the digital twin. Our pipeline is divided into two major steps: (i) first, we compute the curve-skeleton based on a constrained Laplacian smoothing algorithm. This skeletal structure determines the registration of the roots over time; (ii) subsequently, the RSA is robustly modeled by a cylindrical fitting to spatially quantify several traits. The experiment was carried out at the Ag Alumni Seed Phenotyping Facility (AAPF) from Purdue University in West Lafayette (IN, USA). Roots from three samples of tomato plants at two different times and three samples of corn plants at three different times were scanned. The PCA analysis of the skeleton accurately registers temporal roots. Several traits were computed and validated using the root digital twin as ground truth, including number of branches and volume."

A 5M Synchronization Mechanism for Digital Twin Shop-Floor,Paper Metadata,Paper title,A 5M Synchronization Mechanism for Digital Twin Shop-Floor  
A 5M Synchronization Mechanism for Digital Twin Shop-Floor,Paper Metadata,Paper DOI,10.1186/s10033-023-00965-8  
A 5M Synchronization Mechanism for Digital Twin Shop-Floor,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,"In recent years, as a promising way to realize digital transformation, digital twin shop-floor (DTS) plays an important role in smart manufacturing. The core feature of DTS is the synchronization. How to implement and maintain the synchronization is critical for DTS. However, there is still a lack of a common definition for synchronization in DTS. Besides, a systematic synchronization mechanism for DTS is strongly needed. This paper first summarizes the definition and requirements of synchronization in DTS, to clarify the understanding of synchronization in DTS. Then, a 5M synchronization mechanism for DTS is proposed, where 5M refers to multi-system data, multi-fidelity model, multi-resource state, multi-level state, and multi-stage operation. As a bottom-up synchronization mechanism, 5M synchronization mechanism for DTS has the potential to support DTS to achieve and maintain physical-virtual state synchronization, and to realize operation synchronization of DTS. The implementation methods of 5M synchronization mechanism for DTS are also introduced. Finally, the proposed synchronization mechanism is validated in a digital twin satellite assembly shop-floor, which proves the effectiveness and feasibility of the mechanism.  "

A pattern catalog for augmenting Digital Twin models with behavior,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,"Digital Twins are emerging as a solution to build and extend existing software systems to make better use of data produced by physical systems. For supporting the development of Digital Twins, several software vendors are offering dedicated tool support, often referred to as Digital Twin platforms. The modeling capabilities of these platforms are mostly concerned with structural viewpoints, i.e., providing an overview of available components including their current and historical sensor values. However, behavioral viewpoints did not yet receive much attention on these platforms. As behavioral models are often used during the design processes, e.g., for simulation and synthesis, it would be beneficial for having them included in Digital Twin platforms, e.g., for reasoning on the set of possible next actions or for checking the execution history to perform runtime validation. In this paper, we present a catalog of modeling patterns for augmenting Digital Twin models with behavioral models and their corresponding runtime information without requiring any extension of the code bases of Digital Twin platforms. We demonstrate the presented modeling patterns by applying them to the Digital Twin platform offered by Microsoft, in an additive manufacturing use case of a 3D printer in a production line."

A physiologically-based digital twin for alcohol consumption-predicting real-life drinking responses and long-term plasma PEth Check for updates,Paper Metadata,Paper title,A physiologically-based digital twin for alcohol consumption-predicting real-life drinking responses and long-term plasma PEth Check for updates
A physiologically-based digital twin for alcohol consumption-predicting real-life drinking responses and long-term plasma PEth Check for updates,Paper Metadata,Paper DOI,10.1038/s41746-024-01089-6
A physiologically-based digital twin for alcohol consumption-predicting real-life drinking responses and long-term plasma PEth Check for updates,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,"Alcohol consumption is associated with a wide variety of preventable health complications and is a major risk factor for all-cause mortality in the age group 15-47 years. To reduce dangerous drinking behavior, eHealth applications have shown promise. A particularly interesting potential lies in the combination of eHealth apps with mathematical models. However, existing mathematical models do not consider real-life situations, such as combined intake of meals and beverages, and do not connect drinking to clinical markers, such as phosphatidylethanol (PEth). Herein, we present such a model which can simulate real-life situations and connect drinking to long-term markers. The new model can accurately describe both estimation data according to a χ 2 -test (187.0 < T χ2 = 226.4) and independent validation data (70.8 < T χ2 = 93.5). The model can also be personalized using anthropometric data from a specific individual and can thus be used as a physiologically-based digital twin. This twin is also able to connect short-term consumption of alcohol to the long-term dynamics of PEth levels in the blood, a clinical biomarker of alcohol consumption. Here we illustrate how connecting short-term consumption to long-term markers allows for a new way to determine patient alcohol consumption from measured PEth levels. An additional use case of the twin could include the combined evaluation of patientreported AUDIT forms and measured PEth levels. Finally, we integrated the new model into an eHealth application, which could help guide individual users or clinicians to help reduce dangerous drinking."

An Agent-Based Digital Twin for Exploring Localized Non-pharmaceutical Interventions to Control COVID-19 Pandemic,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,"The COVID-19 epidemic created, at the time of writing the paper, highly unusual and uncertain socio-economic conditions. The world economy was severely impacted and business-as-usual activities severely disrupted. The situation presented the necessity to make a trade-off between individual health and safety on one hand and socio-economic progress on the other. Based on the current understanding of the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19, a broad set of control measures has emerged along dimensions such as restricting people's movements, high-volume testing, contract tracing, use of face masks, and enforcement of social-distancing. However, these interventions have their own limitations and varying level of efficacy depending on factors such as the population density and the socio-economic characteristics of the area. To help tailor the intervention, we develop a configurable, fine-grained agent-based simulation model that serves as a virtual representation, i.e., a digital twin of a diverse and heterogeneous area such as a city. In this paper, to illustrate our techniques, we focus our attention on the Indian city of Pune in the western state of Maharashtra. We use the digital twin to simulate various what-if scenarios of interest to (1) predict the spread of the virus; (2) understand the effectiveness of candidate interventions; and (3) predict the consequences of introduction of interventions possibly leading to trade-offs between public health, citizen comfort, and economy. Our model is configured for the specific city of interest and used as an in-silico experimentation aid to predict the trajectory of active infections, mortality rate, load on hospital, and quarantine facility centers for the candidate interventions. The key contributions of this paper are: (1) a novel agent-based model that seamlessly captures people, place, and movement characteristics of the city, COVID-19 virus characteristics, and primitive set of candidate interventions, and (2) a simulation-driven approach to determine the exact intervention that needs to be applied under a given set of circumstances. Although the analysis presented in the paper is highly specific to COVID-19, our tools are generic enough to serve as a template for modeling the impact of future pandemics and formulating bespoke intervention strategies."

Intelligent bridge construction method driven by digital twin,Paper Metadata,Paper DOI,10.11834/jrs.20232590  
Intelligent bridge construction method driven by digital twin,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,"This paper provides an in-depth analysis of the background and development trends of high-precision digital twinning for bridges and their environment as well as intelligent bridge construction. It introduces the theory of virtual geographic environments and digital twinning, explores the use of dynamic data and simulation models to drive spatial modeling and virtual-real mapping throughout bridge construction. The approach includes four stages: monitoring data correlation fusion integrating space, air, and ground monitoring; intelligent modeling methods for digital twinning scenes; dynamic simulation and intelligent prediction methods combining multisource monitoring data; and integration of bridge data, simulation models, and modeling knowledge to establish intelligent management enabling closed-loop control of bridge construction.

An investigation for integration of deep learning and digital twins towards Construction 4.0,Paper Metadata,Paper DOI,10.1108/SASBE-08-2021-0148
An investigation for integration of deep learning and digital twins towards Construction 4.0,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,"Purpose -The purpose of this paper is to investigate the potential integration of deep learning (DL) and digital twins (DT), referred to as (DDT), to facilitate Construction 4.0 through an exploratory analysis. Design/methodology/approach -A mixed approach involving qualitative and quantitative analysis was applied to collect data from global industry experts via interviews, focus groups and a questionnaire survey, with an emphasis on the practicality and interoperability of DDT with decision-support capabilities for process optimization. Findings -Based on the analysis of results, a conceptual model of the framework has been developed. The research findings validate that DL integrated DT model facilitating Construction 4.0 will incorporate cognitive abilities to detect complex and unpredictable actions and reasoning about dynamic process optimization strategies to support decision-making. Practical implications -The DL integrated DT model will establish an interoperable functionality and develop typologies of models described for autonomous real-time interpretation and decision-making support of complex building systems development based on cognitive capabilities of DT. Originality/value -The research explores how the technologies work collaboratively to integrate data from different environments in real-time through the interplay of the optimization and simulation during planning and construction. The framework model is a step for the next level of DT involving process automation and control towards Construction 4.0 to be implemented for different phases of the project lifecycle (designplanning-construction)."

Anti-and pro-fibrillatory effects of pulmonary vein isolation gaps in human atrial fibrillation digital twins Check for updates,Paper Metadata,Paper DOI,10.1038/s41746-024-01075-y
Anti-and pro-fibrillatory effects of pulmonary vein isolation gaps in human atrial fibrillation digital twins Check for updates,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,"Although pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) gaps and extrapulmonary vein triggers contribute to recurrence after atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation, their precise mechanisms remain unproven. Our study assessed the impact of PVI gaps on rhythm outcomes using a human AF digital twin. We included 50 patients (76.0% with persistent AF) who underwent catheter ablation with a realistic AF digital twin by integrating computed tomography and electroanatomical mapping. We evaluated the final rhythm status, including AF and atrial tachycardia (AT), across 600 AF episodes, considering factors including PVI level, PVI gap number, and pacing locations. Our findings revealed that antral PVI had a significantly lower ratio of AF at the final rhythm (28% vs. 56%, p = 0.002) than ostial PVI. Increasing PVI gap numbers correlated with an increased ratio of AF at the final rhythm (p < 0.001). Extra-PV induction yielded a higher ratio of AF at the final rhythm than internal PV induction (77.5% vs. 59.0%, p < 0.001). In conclusion, our human AF digital twin model helped assess AF maintenance mechanisms. Clinical trial registration: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov; Unique identifier: NCT02138695."

Applicability of BIM-IoT-GIS integrated digital twins for post occupancy evaluations,Paper Metadata,Paper title,Applicability of BIM-IoT-GIS integrated digital twins for post occupancy evaluations
Applicability of BIM-IoT-GIS integrated digital twins for post occupancy evaluations,Paper Metadata,Paper DOI,10.3389/fbuil.2023.1103743
Applicability of BIM-IoT-GIS integrated digital twins for post occupancy evaluations,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,"Post Occupancy Evaluations (POE) provided a systematic methodology for determining the performance gap between expected and actual performance. Monitoring quality of the indoor environment is essential for understanding building performance in relation to occupant health, wellbeing, and comfort. Because of the global COVID-19 pandemic, researchers faced numerous issues accessing the building for collecting data and making spot measurements of the indoor environment. Technologies such as Building Information Modeling (BIM), Internet of Things (IoT), and Geographical Information Systems (GIS) have the potential to address existing challenges for data collection, analysis, and visualization in post occupancy evaluations. This study aims to explore the applications of a BIM-IoT-GIS-integrated digital twin for post occupancy evaluations. First, high-level use case scenarios are developed to derive system requirements for a digital twin platform. Second, four tests are conducted that provide a step-by-step procedure for BIM-IoT-GIS integration. Third, the integration is validated by geo-reference checks, data transfer checks, and visual checks. Based on the tests, a streamlined workflow is recommended for similar/future projects. The results demonstrate that Revit-ArcGIS Pro integration meets the system requirements for post occupancy evaluations. Moreover, as shown in the graphical abstract (Figure ), the spatial-temporal capabilities of ArcGIS Pro enable continuous monitoring and visualization of building performance in 4D. In conclusion, BIM-IoT-GIS integration can provide a solid foundation for developing a centralized digital twin for post occupancy evaluations and enables researcher to collect and analyze the data without being physically present in the building."

Application of digital twins for simulation based tailoring of laser induced graphene,Paper Metadata,Paper DOI,10.1038/s41598-024-61237-6
Application of digital twins for simulation based tailoring of laser induced graphene,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,"In the era of man-machine interfaces, digital twins stand as a key technology, offering virtual representations of real-world objects, processes, and systems through computational models. They enable novel ways of interacting with, comprehending, and manipulating real-world entities within a virtual realm. The real implementation of graphene-based sensors and electronic devices remains challenging due to the integration complexities of high-quality graphene materials with existing manufacturing processes. To address this, scalable techniques for the in-situ fabrication of graphene-like materials are essential. One promising method involves using a CO2 laser to convert polyimide into graphene. Optimizing this graphitization process is hindered by complex parameter interactions and nonlinear terms. This article explores how these digital replicas can enhance the fabrication of laser-induced graphene (LIG) through laser simulation and machine learning methods to enable rapid single-step LIG patterning. This approach aims to create a universal simulation for all CO2 lasers, calculating optical energy flux and utilizing machine learning to control and predict LIG conductivity (ability to conduct current), morphology, and electrical resistance. The proposed procedure, integrating digital twins in the LIG production process, will avoid or reduce the preliminary tests required to determine the proper laser parameters to reach the desired LIG characteristics. Accordingly, this approach will reduce the time and costs associated with these tests and thus increase the efficiency and optimize the procedure."

Balancing picking and outbound loading efficiency in an SBS/RS through a digital twin,Paper Metadata,Paper title,Balancing picking and outbound loading efficiency in an SBS/RS through a digital twin
Balancing picking and outbound loading efficiency in an SBS/RS through a digital twin,Paper Metadata,Paper DOI,10.1007/s10696-024-09554-w
Balancing picking and outbound loading efficiency in an SBS/RS through a digital twin,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,"Warehouses are essential elements of almost every Supply Chain and have a significant impact on its performance. However, existing research on warehouse operations mainly aims at maximizing operational performance, neglecting their effect on downstream nodes. In this paper, we propose the use of a digital twin (DT) to support warehouse managers to identify the picking policy that most effectively balances picking and outbound loading efficiencies in an SBS/RS, with the aim of providing both a cost-effective and timely delivery to the subsequent nodes. The problem is set referring to a real case study of the logistics hub of a tire distributor company. The DT was built and validated based on real data from plant sensors and information systems. Afterwards, the DT was used to define three picking strategies that differently impact on both picking and outbound loading efficiency. The DT was then employed on a daily basis and fed with real orders, machine and rack availability to replicate stocking and picking operations and to directly communicate the recommended picking strategy to the warehouse PLC. Several demand scenarios have been considered to extend managerial inferences. Results show that the DT is a valuable tool to support the balancing of picking and outbound loading performance."

Beyond Digital Twins: Phygital Twins for Neuroergonomics in Human-Robot Interaction,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,"Among the most recent enabling technologies, Digital Twins (DTs) emerge as data-intensive network-based computing solutions in multiple domains-from Industry 4.0 to Connected Health. A DT works as a virtual system for replicating, monitoring, predicting, and improving the processes and the features of a physical system-the Physical Twin (PT), connected in real-time with its DT. This position paper proposes a physical-digital twinning approach to improve the understanding and management of the PT in Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) contexts according to neuroergonomics. It introduces the concept of a Phygital Twin (PDT), combining physical and digital elements, enabling intuitive physical interactions and bi-directional real-time data flow between PT and DT. The PDT integrates virtual models and physical replicas, enhancing expert interaction and ecological validity in HRI systems."

Blockchain-based digital twin data provenance for predictive asset management in building facilities,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,"The purpose of this study is to focus on structured data provision and asset information model maintenance and develop a data provenance model on a blockchain-based digital twin smart and sustainable built environment (DT) for predictive asset management (PAM) in building facilities. Qualitative research data were collected through a comprehensive scoping review of secondary sources and interviews with industry specialists. A case study involving a conference room in an office building in Stockholm was conducted to assess the proposed data provenance model. The implementation utilized the Remix Ethereum platform and Sepolia testnet. The model ensures reliability and trustworthiness of data by providing a transparent and immutable record of data origin, ownership and lineage. The model enables decentralized applications (DApps) to publish real-time data from dynamic operations and maintenance processes, enhancing reliability and effectiveness for PAM."

Chapter 16 : Blockchain Based Digital Twin To Predict Heart Attacks,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,"Digital Twin of a person is a virtual representation of that individual and is a model that can be created with real time data such as age, weight, past medical history and current real time health readings. This research work describes the creation of a Digital Twin that can be used to predict heart attacks thereby enabling doctors to perform proactive medical interventions to save human lives. We have developed an application using a headless architecture to enable seamless integration with other medical devices for other critical health conditions. We have used blockchain for security and machine learning to predict heart attacks. The results of our implementation show that heart attack can be predicted with 97.1% accuracy and in parallel can immediately notify the doctors of an imminent heart attack risk in real time using an email. We have also shown that our implementation is tamper proof and highly reliable by testing the application using the concept of Chaos engineering."

Blockchain-enabled digital twin system for brain stroke prediction,Paper Metadata,Paper title,Blockchain-enabled digital twin system for brain stroke prediction
Blockchain-enabled digital twin system for brain stroke prediction,Paper Metadata,Paper DOI,10.1186/s40708-024-00247-6
Blockchain-enabled digital twin system for brain stroke prediction,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,"A digital twin is a virtual model of a real-world system that updates in real-time. In healthcare, digital twins are gaining popularity for monitoring activities like diet, physical activity, and sleep. However, their application in predicting serious conditions such as heart attacks, brain strokes and cancers remains under investigation, with current research showing limited accuracy in such predictions. Moreover, concerns around data security and privacy continue to challenge the widespread adoption of these models. To address these challenges, we developed a secure, machine learning powered digital twin application with three main objectives enhancing prediction accuracy, strengthening security, and ensuring scalability. The application achieved an accuracy of 98.28% for brain stroke prediction on the selected dataset. The data security was enhanced by integrating consortium blockchain technology with machine learning. The results show that the application is tamperproof and is capable of detecting and automatically correcting backend data anomalies to maintain robust data protection. The application can be extended to monitor other pathologies such as heart attacks, cancers, osteoporosis, and epilepsy with minimal configuration changes."

Can we benefit from game engines to develop digital twins for planning the deployment of photovoltaics?,Paper Metadata,Paper DOI,10.1186/s42162-022-00222-7
Can we benefit from game engines to develop digital twins for planning the deployment of photovoltaics?,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,"Digital Twins (DTs) have attracted great attention in the energy sector. Game engines have been suggested to model DTs of their physical counterparts because they provide realistic graphics, lighting-, fluid-and physics engines that simulate the real world. However, the application of game engines to develop DTs for photovoltaics (PVs)  has not yet been discussed in the literature. Therefore, this paper assesses the built-in game engine features' ability to support the DT development of PVs with Unreal Engine 5. This paper mainly focuses on visual representation because the surrounding environment significantly impacts PV deployment, and the existing software tools do not allow the study of the environmental factors at the early planning phase of a project's lifecycle. Furthermore, this paper investigates the position of the sun, shadows and reflections from nearby objects that influence the PVs' power output, and if the built-in light engine can be used for planning the deployment of PVs. The result shows that ingame objects in the environment can be used to affect the simulated PV output estimate over a year. It also indicates that applying Unreal Engine 5 to model PV systems that rely on mirroring real-world behaviour is promising if accurate data is used in the modelling. Real data and mathematical PV models are necessary since Unreal Engine 5's Lumen subsystem cannot provide realistic solar radiance on PVs for a given location on earth."

Chatter model for enabling a digital twin in machining,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,This paper presents the development of a new chatter model using measured cutting forces instead of a mathematical model with empirical nature that describes them. The utilisation of measured cutting forces enables the prediction of real-time chatter conditions and stable machining. The chatter model is validated using fast Fourier transform (FFT) analyses for detection of chatter. The key contribution of the developed chatter model is that it can be incorporated in digital twins for process monitoring and control in order to achieve greater material removal rates and improved surface quality in future industrial applications involving machining processes.

City Information Models (CIMs) as precursors for Urban Digital Twins (UDTs): A case study of Lancaster,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,"City Information Models (CIMs) present several research challenges and are arguably pre-cursors for a roadmap to the transition to Urban or City Digital Twins (UDTs/CDTs) and broader smart city drives. In a period of digital transformation in urban planning, CIMs are primarily designed to intersect and merge urban GIS/BIM in what is termed GeoBIM. CIMs are often cloud-based geospatial services and data repositories with one-way data connections, which differ from integrated and high-fidelity cyber-physical complex systems for digital twins (DTs). However, there is a lack of precision in terms of defining CIMs and UDTs, and this paper examines four broad sociotechnical research challenges regarding the progress of CIMs toward full UDTs/CDTs, including (1) technical training for adoption, (2) acquisition strategies for aerial data and remote sensing, (3) data licensing types and system management, and (4) stakeholder engagement with CIM platforms. These four research challenges and digital transformation are discussed by using back-casting futuring methods, establishing a framework for CIMs through co-designed workshops, and explored in the Lancaster City Information Model (LCIM) prototype. The LCIM, as a resulting case study, was developed for architects, planners, and stakeholders to engage with 3D urban models and urban analytics (view sheds, masterplan scenarios, and solar potentials of buildings) from 2019 to 2021 to address digital inequality in planning and data fragmentation. The framework and prototype results resulted in the most extensive 3D open urban dataset published in the UK, consisting of a baseline of 1″+/-buildings and infrastructure and 7.5 cm aerial imagery and a framework for developing transitions from CIMs to UDTs. The delivery of this case and the resulting published dataset highlights the essential research needed regarding definitions and precision around terminology and systems between CIMs and UDTs and four applied challenges in digital transformation and future sociotechnical relationships."

CitySEIRCast: an agent-based city digital twin for pandemic analysis and simulation,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,"The COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically highlighted the importance of developing simulation systems for quickly characterizing and providing spatio-temporal forecasts of infection spread dynamics that take specific accounts of the population and spatial heterogeneities that govern pathogen transmission in real-world communities. Developing such computational systems must also overcome the cold-start problem related to the inevitable scarce early data and extant knowledge regarding a novel pathogen's transmissibility and virulence, while addressing changing population behavior and policy options as a pandemic evolves. Here, we describe how we have coupled advances in the construction of digital or virtual models of real-world cities with an agile, modular, agent-based model of viral transmission and data from navigation and social media interactions, to overcome these challenges in order to provide a new simulation tool, CitySEIRCast, that can model viral spread at the sub-national level. Our data pipelines and workflows are designed purposefully to be flexible and scalable so that we can implement the system on hybrid cloud/cluster systems and be agile enough to address different population settings and indeed, diseases. Our simulation results demonstrate that CitySEIRCast can provide the timely high resolution spatio-temporal epidemic predictions required for supporting situational awareness of the state of a pandemic as well as for facilitating assessments of vulnerable sub-populations and locations and evaluations of the impacts of implemented interventions, inclusive of the effects of population behavioral response to fluctuations in case incidence. This work arose in response to requests from county agencies to support their work on COVID-19 monitoring, risk assessment, and planning, and using the described workflows, we were able to provide uninterrupted bi-weekly simulations to guide their efforts for over a year from late 2021 to 2023. We discuss future work that can significantly improve the scalability and real-time application of this digital city-based epidemic modelling system, such that validated predictions and forecasts of the paths that may followed by a contagion both over time and space can be used to anticipate the spread dynamics, risky groups and regions, and options for responding effectively to a complex epidemic."

This paper introduces the CitySim dataset that has the core objective of facilitating safety-oriented research and applications. CitySim has vehicle trajectories extracted from 1,140-min of drone videos recorded at 12 locations. It covers a variety of road geometries including freeway basic segments, weaving segments, expressway merge/diverge segments, signalized intersections, stop-controlled intersections, and control-free intersections. CitySim was generated through a five-step procedure that ensured trajectory accuracy. The five-step procedure included video stabilization, object filtering, multivideo stitching, object detection and tracking, and enhanced error filtering. Furthermore, CitySim provides the rotated bounding box information of a vehicle, which was demonstrated to improve safety evaluations. Compared with other video-based trajectory datasets, CitySim had significantly more safety-critical events, including cut-in, merge, and diverge events, which were validated by distributions of both minimum time-to-collision and minimum post encroachment time. In addition, CitySim had the capability to facilitate digital-twin-related research by providing relevant assets, such as the recording locations' three-dimensional base maps and signal timings."

Clinical usefulness of digital twin guided virtual amiodarone test in patients with atrial fibrillation ablation Check for updates,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,"It would be clinically valuable if the efficacy of antiarrhythmic drugs could be simulated in advance. We developed a digital twin to predict amiodarone efficacy in high-risk atrial fibrillation (AF) patients postablation. Virtual left atrium models were created from computed tomography and electroanatomical maps to simulate AF and evaluate its response to varying amiodarone concentrations. As the amiodarone concentration increased in the virtual setting, action potential duration lengthened, peak upstroke velocities decreased, and virtual AF termination became more frequent. Patients were classified into effective (those with virtually terminated AF at therapeutic doses) and ineffective groups. The one-year clinical outcomes after AF ablation showed significantly better results in the effective group compared to the ineffective group, with AF recurrence rates of 20.8% vs. 45.1% (log-rank p = 0.031, adjusted hazard ratio, 0.37 [0.14-0.98]; p = 0.046)."

ClinicalGAN: powering patient monitoring in clinical trials with patient digital twins,Paper Metadata,Paper DOI,10.1038/s41598-024-62567-1  
ClinicalGAN: powering patient monitoring in clinical trials with patient digital twins,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,"Conducting clinical trials is becoming increasingly challenging lately due to spiraling costs, increased time to market, and high failure rates. Patient recruitment and retention is one of the key challenges that impact 90% of the trials directly. While a lot of attention has been given to optimizing patient recruitment, limited progress has been made towards developing comprehensive clinical trial monitoring systems to determine patients at risk and potentially improve patient retention through the right intervention at the right time. Earlier research in patient retention primarily focused on using deterministic frameworks to model the inherently stochastic patient journey process. Existing generative approaches to model temporal data such as TimeGAN or CRBM , face challenges and fail to address key requirements such as personalized generation, variable patient journey, and multivariate time-series needed to model patient digital twin. In response to these challenges, current research proposes ClinicalGAN to enable patient level generation, effectively creating a patient's digital twin. ClinicalGAN provides capabilities for: (a) patient-level personalized generation by utilizing patient meta-data for conditional generation; (b) dynamic termination prediction to enable proactive patient monitoring for improved patient retention; (c) multi-variate time-series training to incorporate relationship and dependencies among different tests measures captured during patient journey. The proposed solution is validated on two Alzheimer's clinical trial datasets and the results are benchmarked across multiple dimensions of generation quality. Empirical results demonstrate that the proposed ClinicalGAN outperforms the SOTA approach by 3-4× on average across all the generation quality metrics. Furthermore, the proposed architecture is shown to outperform predictive methods at the task of drop-off prediction significantly (5-10% MAPE scores).  "

Despite this, their introduction has been hindered by the complex nature of the context itself which leads to many challenges both technical and organizational. In this article, we reviewed the literature about these technologies and their integrations, identifying the most critical requirements for clinical platforms. These latter have been used to design CONNECTED (COmpreheNsive and staNdardized hEalth-Care plaTforms to collEct and harmonize clinical Data), a conceptual framework aimed at defining guidelines to overcome the crucial issues related to the development of healthcare applications. It is structured in a multi-layer shape, in which heterogeneous data sources are first integrated, then standardized, and finally used to realize general-purpose DTs of patients backed by PKGs and accessible through dedicated APIs. These DTs will be the foundation on which smart applications can be built."

Consensus control for distributed power tracking by device-level digital twin agents,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,"The development of electronics and software has resulted in the ability of twin agents to act as digital counterparts for the optimization, control, and monitoring of real power grids. When increasing regulation resources are connected to the power grid, is challenging for independent system operators to use a centralized controller to achieve power tracking and balance. Therefore, the present study applied device-level-based digital twins to monitor physical signals for computer-aided design for power tracking. Moreover, a consensus control-based distributed power tracking system is proposed for the physicalmodel simulation of the power grid. A communication network was also designed for realistic signal exchange. The combination of the proposed distributed power tracking method and communication network can accelerate computational efficiency and protect the privacy of the regulation resources. Finally, the performance of the proposed distributed power tracking method is validated in a simulation system with 10 regulation resources."

Construction of a digital twin model for incremental aggregation of multi type load information in hybrid microgrids under integrity constraints,Paper Metadata,Paper DOI,10.1186/s42162-024-00404-5
Construction of a digital twin model for incremental aggregation of multi type load information in hybrid microgrids under integrity constraints,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,"In the multi type load information of hybrid microgrids, data loss or incompleteness may occur due to network congestion, signal interference, equipment failures, and other reasons. Especially with the continuous generation of new load data, gradually incorporating these new data into the existing aggregation process to achieve continuous updating and optimization of load information. Therefore, this article proposes a digital twin model construction method for incremental aggregation of multi type load information in hybrid microgrids under integrity constraints. The Leida criterion and cubic exponential smoothing method are used to preprocess various load data of hybrid microgrids, remove abnormal data, reduce data fluctuations, and make the data more interpretable. Establish integrity constraints for multiple load data of hybrid microgrids and extract load characteristics of hybrid microgrids. Based on these, establish a digital twin model for the incremental aggregation of multiple load information in a hybrid microgrid, and solve the model using an improved K-means algorithm to achieve continuous updating and optimization of load information. The experimental results show that the data sharing delay of this method is 0.12 s, the load is basically consistent with the actual value, and the relative error of the load data is 4%."

An Agent-Based Digital Twin for Exploring Localized Non-pharmaceutical Interventions to Control COVID-19 Pandemic,Paper Metadata,Paper title,An Agent-Based Digital Twin for Exploring Localized Non-pharmaceutical Interventions to Control COVID-19 Pandemic
An Agent-Based Digital Twin for Exploring Localized Non-pharmaceutical Interventions to Control COVID-19 Pandemic,Paper Metadata,Paper DOI,10.1007/s41403-020-00197-5
An Agent-Based Digital Twin for Exploring Localized Non-pharmaceutical Interventions to Control COVID-19 Pandemic,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,"The COVID-19 epidemic created, at the time of writing the paper, highly unusual and uncertain socio-economic conditions. The world economy was severely impacted and business-as-usual activities severely disrupted. The situation presented the necessity to make a trade-off between individual health and safety on one hand and socio-economic progress on the other. Based on the current understanding of the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19, a broad set of control measures has emerged along dimensions such as restricting people's movements, high-volume testing, contract tracing, use of face masks, and enforcement of social-distancing. However, these interventions have their own limitations and varying level of efficacy depending on factors such as the population density and the socio-economic characteristics of the area. To help tailor the intervention, we develop a configurable, fine-grained agent-based simulation model that serves as a virtual representation, i.e., a digital twin of a diverse and heterogeneous area such as a city. In this paper, to illustrate our techniques, we focus our attention on the Indian city of Pune in the western state of Maharashtra. We use the digital twin to simulate various what-if scenarios of interest to (1) predict the spread of the virus; (2) understand the effectiveness of candidate interventions; and (3) predict the consequences of introduction of interventions possibly leading to trade-offs between public health, citizen comfort, and economy. Our model is configured for the specific city of interest and used as an in-silico experimentation aid to predict the trajectory of active infections, mortality rate, load on hospital, and quarantine facility centers for the candidate interventions. The key contributions of this paper are: (1) a novel agent-based model that seamlessly captures people, place, and movement characteristics of the city, COVID-19 virus characteristics, and primitive set of candidate interventions, and (2) a simulation-driven approach to determine the exact intervention that needs to be applied under a given set of circumstances. Although the analysis presented in the paper is highly specific to COVID-19, our tools are generic enough to serve as a template for modeling the impact of future pandemics and formulating bespoke intervention strategies."

Design/methodology/approach -A mixed approach involving qualitative and quantitative analysis was applied to collect data from global industry experts via interviews, focus groups and a questionnaire survey, with an emphasis on the practicality and interoperability of DDT with decision-support capabilities for process optimization. Findings -Based on the analysis of results, a conceptual model of the framework has been developed. The research findings validate that DL integrated DT model facilitating Construction 4.0 will incorporate cognitive abilities to detect complex and unpredictable actions and reasoning about dynamic process optimization strategies to support decision-making. Practical implications -The DL integrated DT model will establish an interoperable functionality and develop typologies of models described for autonomous real-time interpretation and decision-making support of complex building systems development based on cognitive capabilities of DT. Originality/value -The research explores how the technologies work collaboratively to integrate data from different environments in real-time through the interplay of the optimization and simulation during planning and construction. The framework model is a step for the next level of DT involving process automation and control towards Construction 4.0 to be implemented for different phases of the project lifecycle (designplanning-construction)."

Anomaly detection in Skin Model Shapes using machine learning classifiers,Paper Metadata,Paper title,Anomaly detection in Skin Model Shapes using machine learning classifiers
Anomaly detection in Skin Model Shapes using machine learning classifiers,Paper Metadata,Paper DOI,10.1007/s00170-019-03794-z
Anomaly detection in Skin Model Shapes using machine learning classifiers,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,"The concept of Skin Model Shapes has been proposed as a method to generate digital twins of manufactured parts and is a new paradigm in the design and manufacturing industry. Skin Model Shapes use discrete surface representation schemes, such as meshes and point clouds, to represent surfaces, which makes them enablers to perform an accurate tolerance analysis and surface inspection. However, online inspection of manufactured parts through use of Skin Model Shapes has not been extensively studied. Moreover, the existing geometric variation inspection techniques do not detect unfamiliar changes within tolerance, which could be the precursors to the onset of the manufacturing of out of tolerance part. To detect the unfamiliar changes, as anomalies, and categorize them as systematic and random variations, some unique surface characteristics can be extracted and studied. Random surface deviations exhibit narrow normal distributions, and systematic deviations, on the other hand, exhibit wide, skewed, and multimodal distributions. Using those surface characteristics as key traits, machine learning classifiers can be used to classify deviations into systematic and random variations. To illustrate the method, multiple samples from a truck component manufacturing line were scanned and the collected 3D point cloud data was used to extract features. A prediction score of 97-100% can be achieved by decision tree, k-nearest neighbor, support vector machines, and ensemble classifiers. The purposed approach is expected to extend the existing online inspection approaches and applications of Skin Model Shapes in quality control."

Anti-and pro-fibrillatory effects of pulmonary vein isolation gaps in human atrial fibrillation digital twins Check for updates,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,"Although pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) gaps and extrapulmonary vein triggers contribute to recurrence after atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation, their precise mechanisms remain unproven. Our study assessed the impact of PVI gaps on rhythm outcomes using a human AF digital twin. We included 50 patients (76.0% with persistent AF) who underwent catheter ablation with a realistic AF digital twin by integrating computed tomography and electroanatomical mapping. We evaluated the final rhythm status, including AF and atrial tachycardia (AT), across 600 AF episodes, considering factors including PVI level, PVI gap number, and pacing locations. Our findings revealed that antral PVI had a significantly lower ratio of AF at the final rhythm (28% vs. 56%, p = 0.002) than ostial PVI. Increasing PVI gap numbers correlated with an increased ratio of AF at the final rhythm (p < 0.001). Extra-PV induction yielded a higher ratio of AF at the final rhythm than internal PV induction (77.5% vs. 59.0%, p < 0.001). In conclusion, our human AF digital twin model helped assess AF maintenance mechanisms. Clinical trial registration: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov; Unique identifier: NCT02138695.  "

Applicability of BIM-IoT-GIS integrated digital twins for post occupancy evaluations,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,"Post Occupancy Evaluations (POE) provided a systematic methodology for determining the performance gap between expected and actual performance. Monitoring quality of the indoor environment is essential for understanding building performance in relation to occupant health, wellbeing, and comfort. Because of the global COVID-19 pandemic, researchers faced numerous issues accessing the building for collecting data and making spot measurements of the indoor environment. Technologies such as Building Information Modeling (BIM), Internet of Things (IoT), and Geographical Information Systems (GIS) have the potential to address existing challenges for data collection, analysis, and visualization in post occupancy evaluations. This study aims to explore the applications of a BIM-IoT-GIS-integrated digital twin for post occupancy evaluations. First, high-level use case scenarios are developed to derive system requirements for a digital twin platform. Second, four tests are conducted that provide a step-by-step procedure for BIM-IoT-GIS integration. Third, the integration is validated by geo-reference checks, data transfer checks, and visual checks. Based on the tests, a streamlined workflow is recommended for similar/future projects. The results demonstrate that Revit-ArcGIS Pro integration meets the system requirements for post occupancy evaluations. Moreover, as shown in the graphical abstract (Figure ), the spatial-temporal capabilities of ArcGIS Pro enable continuous monitoring and visualization of building performance in 4D. In conclusion, BIM-IoT-GIS integration can provide a solid foundation for developing a centralized digital twin for post occupancy evaluations and enables researcher to collect and analyze the data without being physically present in the building."

Application of digital twins for simulation based tailoring of laser induced graphene,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,"In the era of man-machine interfaces, digital twins stand as a key technology, offering virtual representations of real-world objects, processes, and systems through computational models. They enable novel ways of interacting with, comprehending, and manipulating real-world entities within a virtual realm. The real implementation of graphene-based sensors and electronic devices remains challenging due to the integration complexities of high-quality graphene materials with existing manufacturing processes. To address this, scalable techniques for the in-situ fabrication of graphene-like materials are essential. One promising method involves using a CO2 laser to convert polyimide into graphene. Optimizing this graphitization process is hindered by complex parameter interactions and nonlinear terms. This article explores how these digital replicas can enhance the fabrication of laser-induced graphene (LIG) through laser simulation and machine learning methods to enable rapid single-step LIG patterning. This approach aims to create a universal simulation for all CO2 lasers, calculating optical energy flux and utilizing machine learning to control and predict LIG conductivity (ability to conduct current), morphology, and electrical resistance. The proposed procedure, integrating digital twins in the LIG production process, will avoid or reduce the preliminary tests required to determine the proper laser parameters to reach the desired LIG characteristics. Accordingly, this approach will reduce the time and costs associated with these tests and thus increase the efficiency and optimize the procedure."

,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,"We are currently facing a substantial transformation of our industrial world and the way our economics are organized. This transformation, known as digitalization, is driven by the systemic integration of information technology in all kinds of devices, machines, and factories such that new smart networks are formed and new smart products have the ability to monitor, to forecast, and to control their behavior. One of the fundamental pillars of digitalization is simulation technology, since it enables the new intelligence layer in the form of digital twins which mirror the physical systems into the digital world -also named by Gartner Inc. as a top technology trend for 2017 and 2018. Creating such intelligence layers over several domains and life cycle phases requires, among other challenges, technologies for transforming and reducing complex simulation models. Exactly for this task a key technology is model order reduction (MOR). However, MOR is not only a key technology within emerging digital twins but also helps to reduce simulation times in the existing everyday business of simulation engineers. This is especially important when for a simulation model a large number of evaluations are needed. Within this chapter we present use cases where MOR is a key enabler for the realization of digital services and the reduction of simulation times. Furthermore we outline the potential of MOR in the context of realizing the digital twin vision."

4D Structural root architecture modeling from digital twins by X-Ray Computed Tomography,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,"Breakthrough imaging technologies may challenge the plant phenotyping bottleneck regarding marker-assisted breeding and genetic mapping. In this context, X-Ray CT (computed tomography) technology can accurately obtain the digital twin of root system architecture (RSA) but computational methods to quantify RSA traits and analyze their changes over time are limited. RSA traits extremely affect agricultural productivity. We develop a spatial-temporal root architectural modeling method based on 4D data from X-ray CT. This novel approach is optimized for high-throughput phenotyping considering the cost-effective time to process the data and the accuracy and robustness of the results. Significant root architectural traits, including root elongation rate, number, length, growth angle, height, diameter, branching map, and volume of axial and lateral roots are extracted from the model based on the digital twin. Our pipeline is divided into two major steps: (i) first, we compute the curve-skeleton based on a constrained Laplacian smoothing algorithm. This skeletal structure determines the registration of the roots over time; (ii) subsequently, the RSA is robustly modeled by a cylindrical fitting to spatially quantify several traits. The experiment was carried out at the Ag Alumni Seed Phenotyping Facility (AAPF) from Purdue University in West Lafayette (IN, USA). Roots from three samples of tomato plants at two different times and three samples of corn plants at three different times were scanned. The PCA analysis of the skeleton accurately registers temporal roots. Several traits were computed and validated using the root digital twin as ground truth against the cylindrical model: number of branches (RRMSE better than 9%) and volume (R2 = 0.84, P < 0.001). The methodology provides scalability for high throughput root phenotyping."

A 5M Synchronization Mechanism for Digital Twin Shop-Floor,Paper Metadata,Paper DOI,10.1186/s10033-023-00965-8  
A 5M Synchronization Mechanism for Digital Twin Shop-Floor,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,"In recent years, as a promising way to realize digital transformation, digital twin shop-floor (DTS) plays an important role in smart manufacturing. The core feature of DTS is the synchronization. How to implement and maintain the synchronization is critical for DTS. However, there is still a lack of a common definition for synchronization in DTS. Besides, a systematic synchronization mechanism for DTS is strongly needed. This paper first summarizes the definition and requirements of synchronization in DTS, to clarify the understanding of synchronization in DTS. Then, a 5M synchronization mechanism for DTS is proposed, where 5M refers to multi-system data, multi-fidelity model, multi-resource state, multi-level state, and multi-stage operation. As a bottom-up synchronization mechanism, 5M synchronization mechanism for DTS has the potential to support DTS to achieve and maintain physical-virtual state synchronization, and to realize operation synchronization of DTS. The implementation methods of 5M synchronization mechanism for DTS are also introduced. Finally, the proposed synchronization mechanism is validated in a digital twin satellite assembly shop-floor, which proves the effectiveness and feasibility of the mechanism.  "

A Novel Digital Twin Strategy to Examine the Implications of Randomized Control Trials for Real-World Populations,Paper Metadata,Paper title,A Novel Digital Twin Strategy to Examine the Implications of Randomized Control Trials for Real-World Populations
A Novel Digital Twin Strategy to Examine the Implications of Randomized Control Trials for Real-World Populations,Paper Metadata,Paper DOI,10.1101/2024.03.25.24304868
A Novel Digital Twin Strategy to Examine the Implications of Randomized Control Trials for Real-World Populations,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,"Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) are essential to guide medical practice; however, their generalizability to a given population is often uncertain. We developed a statistically informed Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) model, RCT-Twin-GAN, that leverages relationships between covariates and outcomes and generates a digital twin of an RCT (RCT-Twin) conditioned on covariate distributions from a second patient population. We used RCT-Twin-GAN to reproduce treatment effect outcomes of the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT) and the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) Blood Pressure Trial, which tested the same intervention but had different treatment effect results. To demonstrate treatment effect estimates of each RCT conditioned on the other RCT patient population, we evaluated the cardiovascular event-free survival of SPRINT digital twins conditioned on the ACCORD cohort and vice versa (SPRINT-conditioned ACCORD twins). The conditioned digital twins were balanced by the intervention arm (mean absolute standardized mean difference (MASMD) of covariates between treatment arms 0.019 (SD 0.018), and the conditioned covariates of the SPRINT-Twin on ACCORD were more similar to ACCORD than a sprint (MASMD 0.0082 SD 0.016 vs. 0.46 SD 0.20). Most importantly, across iterations, SPRINT conditioned ACCORD-Twin datasets reproduced the overall non-significant effect size seen in ACCORD (5-year cardiovascular outcome hazard ratio (95% confidence interval) of 0.88 (0.73-1.06) in ACCORD vs median 0.87 (0.68-1.13) in the SPRINT conditioned ACCORD-Twin), while the ACCORD conditioned SPRINT-Twins reproduced the significant effect size seen in SPRINT (0.75 (0.64-0.89) vs median 0.79 (0.72-0.86)) in ACCORD conditioned SPRINT-Twin). Finally, we describe the translation of this approach to real-world populations by conditioning the trials on an electronic health record population. Therefore, RCT-Twin-GAN simulates the direct translation of RCT-derived treatment effects across various patient populations with varying covariate distributions."

A pattern catalog for augmenting Digital Twin models with behavior,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,"Digital Twins are emerging as a solution to build and extend existing software systems to make better use of data produced by physical systems. For supporting the development of Digital Twins, several software vendors are offering dedicated tool support, often referred to as Digital Twin platforms. The modeling capabilities of these platforms are mostly concerned with structural viewpoints, i.e., providing an overview of available components including their current and historical sensor values. However, behavioral viewpoints did not yet receive much attention on these platforms. As behavioral models are often used during the design processes, e.g., for simulation and synthesis, it would be beneficial for having them included in Digital Twin platforms, e.g., for reasoning on the set of possible next actions or for checking the execution history to perform runtime validation. In this paper, we present a catalog of modeling patterns for augmenting Digital Twin models with behavioral models and their corresponding runtime information without requiring any extension of the code bases of Digital Twin platforms. We demonstrate the presented modeling patterns by applying them to the Digital Twin platform offered by Microsoft, in an additive manufacturing use case of a 3D printer in a production line.  "

A physiologically-based digital twin for alcohol consumption-predicting real-life drinking responses and long-term plasma PEth Check for updates,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,"Alcohol consumption is associated with a wide variety of preventable health complications and is a major risk factor for all-cause mortality in the age group 15-47 years. To reduce dangerous drinking behavior, eHealth applications have shown promise. A particularly interesting potential lies in the combination of eHealth apps with mathematical models. However, existing mathematical models do not consider real-life situations, such as combined intake of meals and beverages, and do not connect drinking to clinical markers, such as phosphatidylethanol (PEth). Herein, we present such a model which can simulate real-life situations and connect drinking to long-term markers. The new model can accurately describe both estimation data according to a χ2-test (187.0 < Tχ2 = 226.4) and independent validation data (70.8 < Tχ2 = 93.5). The model can also be personalized using anthropometric data from a specific individual and can thus be used as a physiologically-based digital twin. This twin is also able to connect short-term consumption of alcohol to the long-term dynamics of PEth levels in the blood, a clinical biomarker of alcohol consumption. Here we illustrate how connecting short-term consumption to long-term markers allows for a new way to determine patient alcohol consumption from measured PEth levels. An additional use case of the twin could include the combined evaluation of patient-reported AUDIT forms and measured PEth levels. Finally, we integrated the new model into an eHealth application, which could help guide individual users or clinicians to help reduce dangerous drinking."

ABWOA: adaptive boundary whale optimization algorithm for large-scale digital twin network construction,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,"Digital twin network (DTN) as an emerging network paradigm, have garnered growing attention. For large-scale networks, a crucial problem is how to effectively map physical networks onto the infrastructure platform of DTN. To address this issue, we propose a heuristic method of the adaptive boundary whale optimization algorithm (ABWOA) to solve the digital twin network construction problem, improving the efficiency and reducing operational costs of DTN. Extensive comparison experiments are conducted between ABWOA and various algorithms such as genetic algorithm, particle swarm optimization, artificial bee colony, differential evolution algorithm, moth search algorithm and original whale optimization algorithm. The experimental results show that ABWOA is superior to other algorithms in terms of solution quality, convergence speed, and time cost. It can solve the digital twin network construction problem more effectively."

ACT-R based human digital twin to enhance operators' performance in process industries,Paper Metadata,Paper DOI,10.3389/fnhum.2023.1038060  
ACT-R based human digital twin to enhance operators' performance in process industries,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,"To ensure safe and efficient operation, operators in process industries have to make timely decisions based on time-varying information. A holistic assessment of operators' performance is, therefore, challenging. Current approaches to operator performance assessment are subjective and ignore operators' cognitive behavior. In addition, these cannot be used to predict operators' expected responses during novel situations that may arise during plant operations. The present study seeks to develop a human digital twin (HDT) that can simulate a control room operator's behavior, even during various abnormal situations. The HDT has been developed using the ACT-R (Adaptive Control of Thought-Rational) cognitive architecture. It mimics a human operator as they monitor the process and intervene during abnormal situations. We conducted 426 trials to test the HDT's ability to handle disturbance rejection tasks. In these simulations, we varied the reward and penalty parameters to provide feedback to the HDT. We validated the HDT using the eye gaze behavior of 10 human subjects who completed 110 similar disturbance rejection tasks as that of the HDT. The results indicate that the HDT exhibits similar gaze behaviors as the human subjects, even when dealing with abnormal situations. These indicate that the HDT's cognitive capabilities are comparable to those of human operators. As possible applications, the proposed HDT can be used to generate a large database of human behavior during abnormalities which can then be used to spot and rectify flaws in novice operator's mental models. Additionally, the HDT can also enhance operators' decision-making during real-time operation.  "

Adaptive Impact Factor Research Concerning Effectiveness of the Introduction and use of Digital Twins for Oil and Gas Deposits,Paper Metadata,Paper title,Adaptive Impact Factor Research Concerning Effectiveness of the Introduction and use of Digital Twins for Oil and Gas Deposits
Adaptive Impact Factor Research Concerning Effectiveness of the Introduction and use of Digital Twins for Oil and Gas Deposits,Paper Metadata,Paper DOI,10.6000/1929-4409.2020.09.239
Adaptive Impact Factor Research Concerning Effectiveness of the Introduction and use of Digital Twins for Oil and Gas Deposits,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,"In recent years, there have been significant changes in the conditions of oil production leading to an increase in its cost and wasteful use of resources. This necessitates the search for a system of adaptive factors that can adapt to environmental changes, affect the cost reduction and increase in the efficiency of oil and gas fields. Studies show that this problem needs to be solved on the basis of the creation of digital oil or gas fields being digital counterparts of existing enterprises, which allow preserving nature and use resources economically due to the existing field development at a new qualitative level. However, the transformation of existing fields through their transformation into digital oil or gas fields requires serious justification, and above all, from a financial and economic points of view. At the same time, one should in no case ignore the natural factor contributing to saving, restoring the used oil and gas resources and preserving the external space being the human environment. The purpose of this study is to develop recommendations for assessing the economic efficiency of the implementation of the project concerning a digital oil or gas field being a digital twin of oil or gas enterprise, and their use in practice. Such an assessment will be carried out based on the analysis of the ratio between capital investments and operating costs necessary to create a digital oil or gas field, as well as by comparing the expected costs and benefits derived from its use."

Advances and utility of digital twins in critical care and acute care medicine: a narrative review,Paper Metadata,Paper title,Advances and utility of digital twins in critical care and acute care medicine: a narrative review
Advances and utility of digital twins in critical care and acute care medicine: a narrative review,Paper Metadata,Paper DOI,10.12701/jyms.2024.01053
Advances and utility of digital twins in critical care and acute care medicine: a narrative review,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,"Accurate detection, differentiation, and characterization of both neoplastic and non-neoplastic colon polyps, with an average accuracy rate of 91.5%. Critical care is one of the most data-rich areas of healthcare and one of the largest areas where AI-related technologies can find fertile soil to grow and iteratively refine at a swift pace. However, introducing these innovations in settings where patients are critically ill or in life-or-death situations can be challenging. This narrative review focuses on the evolving discussion of the utility of AI and clinical informatics in critical care and acute care medicine, specifically focusing on digital twin (DT) technology. The improved computational power and iterative validation of these intelligent tools have enhanced medical education, in silico research, and clinical decision support in critical care settings. Integrating DTs into critical care opens vast opportunities, but simultaneously poses complex challenges, from data safety and privacy concerns to potentially increasing healthcare disparities. In medicine, DTs can significantly improve the efficiency of critical care systems. Stakeholder investment is essential for successful implementation and integration of these technologies."

Context awareness in process monitoring of additive manufacturing using a digital twin,Paper Metadata,Paper DOI,10.1007/s00170-021-08636-5
Context awareness in process monitoring of additive manufacturing using a digital twin,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,"Wire Arc Additive Manufacturing allows the cost-effective manufacturing of customized, large-scale metal parts. As the post-process quality assurance of large parts is costly and time-consuming, process monitoring is inevitable. In the present study, a context-aware monitoring solution was investigated by integrating machine, temporal, and spatial context in the data analysis. By analyzing the voltage patterns of each cycle in the oscillating cold metal transfer process with a deep neural network, temporal context was included. Spatial context awareness was enabled by building a digital twin of the manufactured part using an Octree as spatial indexing data structure. By means of the spatial context awareness, two quality metrics-the defect expansion and the local anomaly density-were introduced. The defect expansion was tracked in-process by assigning detected defects to the same defect cluster in case of spatial correlation. The local anomaly density was derived by defining a spherical region of interest which enabled the detection of aggregations of anomalies. By means of the context aware monitoring system, defects were detected in-process with a higher sensitivity as common defect detectors for welding applications, showing less false-positives and false-negatives. A quantitative evaluation of defect expansion and densities of various defect types such as pore nests was enabled."

Continuous Evolution of Digital Twins using the DarTwin Notation,Paper Metadata,Paper title,Continuous Evolution of Digital Twins using the DarTwin Notation
Continuous Evolution of Digital Twins using the DarTwin Notation,Paper Metadata,Paper DOI,10.1007/s10270-024-01216-7
Continuous Evolution of Digital Twins using the DarTwin Notation,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,"Despite best efforts, various challenges remain in the creation and maintenance processes of digital twins (DTs). One of those primary challenges is the constant, continuous and omnipresent evolution of systems, their user's needs and their environment, demanding the adaptation of the developed DT systems. DTs are developed for a specific purpose, which generally entails the monitoring, analysis, simulation or optimisation of a specific aspect of an actual system, referred to as the actual twin (AT). As such, when the twin system changes, that is either the AT itself changes, or the scope/purpose of a DT is modified, the DTs usually evolve in close synchronicity with the AT. As DTs are software systems, the best practices or methodologies for software evolution can be leveraged. This paper tackles the challenge of maintaining a (set of) DT(s) throughout the evolution of the user's requirements and priorities and tries to understand how this evolution takes place. In doing so, we provide two contributions: (i) we develop DarTwin, a visual notation form that enables reasoning on a twin system, its purposes, properties and implementation, and (ii) we introduce a set of architectural transformations that describe the evolution of DT systems. The development of these transformations is driven and illustrated by the evolution and transformations of a family home's DT, whose purpose is expanded, changed and re-prioritised throughout its ongoing lifecycle. Additionally, we evaluate the transformations on a laboratory-scale gantry crane's DT."

Process-Structure-Property Relationship of Lightweight Metallic Materials Correlation of digital twin and roll surface sensor results for AZ31 alloy TRC process,Paper Metadata,Paper DOI,10.1007/s10853-024-09733-y
Process-Structure-Property Relationship of Lightweight Metallic Materials Correlation of digital twin and roll surface sensor results for AZ31 alloy TRC process,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,"Due to the growing interest in lightweight constructions, the continuous casting of nonferrous metals is continuously developing as a result of the cost-effectiveness of this process, which combines several stages of sheet production. Unfortunately, because of the characteristics of the process, the parameters in the roll gap, such as, for example, pressure and temperature, are unknown, significantly affects the understanding of the phenomena occurring in the material during rolling. Therefore, at IMF Freiberg, a sensor consisting of a piezo sensor and two thermocouples measuring the temperature at two different heights was mounted on the surface of the roll, making it possible to control the process parameters live during the TRC trial. The measurements were further supported by a digital twin in the form of a layer model, combining a viscous and solid region for each layer in a single tool. The computations in this tool are performed offline and the computation time is in the order of seconds, thus much less than that of the finite element method. Because the layer model measures the temperature of the magnesium strip, FEM simulations were used to validate measurements from thermocouples. Experimental results have been obtained that allow for a direct correlation between the development of the pressure and temperature and the length of the fully solidified L D part in the roll gap zone, which correlates directly with the effective total equivalent strain. Using the sensor and layer model, it is possible to train a digital twin that can be used for online estimation of the final strip properties obtained in the TRC process."

Cultural heritage digital twin: modeling and representing the visual narrative in Leonardo Da Vinci's Mona Lisa,Paper Metadata,Paper title,Cultural heritage digital twin: modeling and representing the visual narrative in Leonardo Da Vinci's Mona Lisa
Cultural heritage digital twin: modeling and representing the visual narrative in Leonardo Da Vinci's Mona Lisa,Paper Metadata,Paper DOI,10.1007/s00521-024-10010-x
Cultural heritage digital twin: modeling and representing the visual narrative in Leonardo Da Vinci's Mona Lisa,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,"In this paper, Artificial Intelligence/Knowledge Representation methods are used for the digital modeling of cultural heritage elements. Accordingly, the new concept of digital cultural heritage twin is presented as composed of a physical component and an immaterial component of the cultural entity. The former concerns the physical aspects, i.e. style, name of the artist, execution time, dimension, etc. The latter represents the emotional and intangible aspects transmitted by the entity, i.e. emotions, thoughts, opinions. In order to digitally model the physical and immaterial components of the twin, the Narrative Knowledge Representation Language has been formally introduced and described. It is particularly suitable for representing the immaterial aspects of the cultural entity, as it is capable of modeling in a simple but rigorous and efficient way complex situations and events, behaviours, attitudes, etc. As an experiment, NKRL has been adopted for representing some of the most relevant intangible items of the visual narrative underlying the hidden painting that lies beneath the Mona Lisa (La Gioconda) image painted by Leonardo Da Vinci on the same poplar panel. Real-time application of the resulting knowledge base opens up novel possibilities for the development of virtual objects, chatbots and expert systems, as well as the definition of semantic search platforms related to cultural heritage."

CYBERSECURITY FOR DIGITAL TWINS IN THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT: CURRENT RESEARCH AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,"Recent technological developments in the construction industry are seeking to create smart cities by using Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) to enhance information models such as BIM. Currently, BIM models are commonly adopted to work with IoT-based systems and embrace smart technologies that offer interoperability in the communication layer. In future, it is envisioned that digital twins will provide new possibilities for cyberphysical systems via monitoring and simulation. However, rarely in this rapidly developing field is security fully considered. This paper reviews the relevant literature regarding the use of the IoT in the built environment and analyses current practices. It also presents examples of cities that use the IoT to improve construction and the lived experience. Finally, it reviews how digital twins factor in multiple layers defined in CPSs, from physical objects to information models. Based on this review, recommendations are provided documenting how BIM specifications can be expanded to become IoT compliant, enhancing standards to support cybersecurity, and ensuring digital twin and city standards can be fully integrated in future secure smart cities."

A Proposal for a FAIR Management of 3D Data in Cultural Heritage: The Aldrovandi Digital Twin Case,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,"In this article we analyse 3D models of cultural heritage with the aim of answering three main questions: what processes can be put in place to create a FAIR-by-design digital twin of a temporary exhibition? What are the main challenges in applying FAIR principles to 3D data in cultural heritage studies and how are they different from other types of data (e.g. images) from a data management perspective? We begin with a comprehensive literature review touching on: FAIR principles applied to cultural heritage data; representation models; both Object Provenance Information (OPI) and Metadata Record Provenance Information (MRPI), respectively meant as, on the one hand, the detailed history and origin of an object, and -on the other hand -the detailed history and origin of the metadata itself, which describes the primary object (whether physical or digital); 3D models as cultural heritage research data and their creation, selection, publication, archival and preservation. We then describe the process of creating the Aldrovandi Digital Twin, by collecting, storing and modelling data about cultural heritage objects and processes. We detail the many steps from the acquisition of the Digital Cultural Heritage Objects (DCHO), through to the upload of the optimised"

A real-time digital twin for active safety in an aircraft hangar,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,"The aerospace industry prioritises safety protocols to prevent accidents that can result in injuries, fatalities, or aircraft damage. One of the potential hazards that can occur while manoeuvring aircraft in and out of a hangar is collisions with other aircraft or buildings, which can lead to operational disruption and costly repairs. To tackle this issue, we have developed the Smart Hangar project, which aims to alert personnel of increased risks and prevent incidents from happening. The Smart Hangar project uses computer vision, LiDAR, and ultra-wideband sensors to track all objects and individuals within the hangar space. These data inputs are combined to form a real-time 3D Digital Twin (DT) of the hangar environment. The Active Safety system then uses the DT to perform real-time path planning, collision prediction, and safety alerts for tow truck drivers and hangar personnel. This paper provides a detailed overview of the system architecture, including the technologies used, and highlights the system's performance. By implementing this system, we aim to reduce the risk of accidents in the aerospace industry and increase safety for all personnel involved. Additionally, we identify future research directions for the Smart Hangar project.  "

A Self-Healing and Fault-Tolerant Cloud-based Digital Twin Processing Management Model,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,"Digital twins, integral to cloud platforms, bridge physical and virtual worlds, fostering collaboration among stakeholders in manufacturing and processing. However, the cloud platforms face challenges like service outages, vulnerabilities, and resource contention, hindering critical digital twin application development. The existing research works have limited focus on reliability and fault tolerance in digital twin processing. In this context, this paper proposed a novel Self-healing and Faulttolerant cloud-based Digital Twin processing Management (SF-DTM) model. It employs collaborative digital twin tasks resource requirement estimation unit which utilizes newly devised Federated learning with cosine Similarity integration (SimiFed). Further, SF-DTM incorporates a self-healing fault-tolerance strategy employing a frequent sequence fault-prone pattern analytics unit for deciding the most admissible VM allocation. The implementation and evaluation of SF-DTM model using real traces demonstrates its effectiveness and resilience, revealing improved availability, higher Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF), and lower Mean Time To Repair (MTTR) compared with non-SF-DTM approaches, enhancing collaborative DT application management. SF-DTM improved the services availability up to 13.2% over non-SF-DTM-based DT processing."

A simulation based digital twin approach to assessing the organization of response to emergency calls Check for updates,Paper Metadata,Paper DOI,10.1038/s41746-024-01392-2
A simulation based digital twin approach to assessing the organization of response to emergency calls Check for updates,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,"In emergency situations, timely contact with emergency medical communication centers (EMCCs) is critical for patient outcomes. Increasing call volumes and economic constraints are challenging many countries, necessitating organizational changes in EMCCs. This study uses a simulation-based digital twin approach, creating a virtual model of EMCC operations to assess the impact of different organizational scenarios on accessibility. Specifically, we explore two decompartmentalized scenarios where traditionally isolated call centers are reorganized to enable more flexible call distribution. The primary measure of accessibility was service quality within 30 s of call reception. Our results show that decompartmentalization improves service quality by 17% to 21%. This study demonstrates that reducing regional isolation in EMCCs can enhance performance and accessibility with a simulation-based digital twin approach providing a clear and objective method to quantify the benefits."

A virtual commissioning based methodology to integrate digital twins into manufacturing systems,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,"Digital Twin (DT) is considered a key approach to enhance the system reactivity to uncertain events due to its ability to getting data from the field and triggering actions on the physical asset. Given the modern technological and rapidly changing work environment, it is likely that in the next years companies will need to retrofit their manufacturing systems by integrating DTs. In this context, it is fundamental to define the necessary steps for the development of DTs and for their integration into manufacturing systems through a DT architecture. In response to this issue, a methodology based on Virtual Commissioning is proposed. A stepwise approach is illustrated in which the DT is designed, integrated and verified using a virtual environment. The methodology is validated through the integration of a DT into a flow shop for the implementation of a scheduling reactive to machine breakdown. By following the steps of the proposed methodology, a DT architecture able to improve the makespan of the studied flow shop is developed, suggesting the potential applicability of the approach to industrial manufacturing systems."

A sink hole and caves caused by earth balance shield and digital twin observational method to control face stability,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,A sink hole was found at ground surface in a residential area in Tokyo in October 2020. The site was above a construction line of earth pressure balance shield tunnel with16.1 m in diameter and the crown at the depth of GL-47m. Further study revealed the dense sand layer above the tunnel has been loosened along the tunnel for about 200m length from the tunnel face. 3DFEM simulation based upon the site conditions showed a possibility of the loosing stability of the face when the ground is dense sand with little fine component. A digital twin observational method is proposed to discuss the face stability and to keep digging safe.

CitySEIRCast: an agent-based city digital twin for pandemic analysis and simulation,Paper Metadata,Paper title,CitySEIRCast: an agent-based city digital twin for pandemic analysis and simulation
CitySEIRCast: an agent-based city digital twin for pandemic analysis and simulation,Paper Metadata,Paper DOI,10.1007/s40747-024-01683-x
CitySEIRCast: an agent-based city digital twin for pandemic analysis and simulation,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,"The COVID-19 pandemic has dramatically highlighted the importance of developing simulation systems for quickly characterizing and providing spatio-temporal forecasts of infection spread dynamics that take specific accounts of the population and spatial heterogeneities that govern pathogen transmission in real-world communities. Developing such computational systems must also overcome the cold-start problem related to the inevitable scarce early data and extant knowledge regarding a novel pathogen's transmissibility and virulence, while addressing changing population behavior and policy options as a pandemic evolves. Here, we describe how we have coupled advances in the construction of digital or virtual models of real-world cities with an agile, modular, agent-based model of viral transmission and data from navigation and social media interactions, to overcome these challenges in order to provide a new simulation tool, CitySEIRCast, that can model viral spread at the sub-national level. Our data pipelines and workflows are designed purposefully to be flexible and scalable so that we can implement the system on hybrid cloud/cluster systems and be agile enough to address different population settings and indeed, diseases. Our simulation results demonstrate that CitySEIRCast can provide the timely high resolution spatio-temporal epidemic predictions required for supporting situational awareness of the state of a pandemic as well as for facilitating assessments of vulnerable sub-populations and locations and evaluations of the impacts of implemented interventions, inclusive of the effects of population behavioral response to fluctuations in case incidence. This work arose in response to requests from county agencies to support their work on COVID-19 monitoring, risk assessment, and planning, and using the described workflows, we were able to provide uninterrupted bi-weekly simulations to guide their efforts for over a year from late 2021 to 2023. We discuss future work that can significantly improve the scalability and real-time application of this digital city-based epidemic modelling system, such that validated predictions and forecasts of the paths that may followed by a contagion both over time and space can be used to anticipate the spread dynamics, risky groups and regions, and options for responding effectively to a complex epidemic."

Balancing picking and outbound loading efficiency in an SBS/RS through a digital twin,Paper Metadata,Paper title,Balancing picking and outbound loading efficiency in an SBS/RS through a digital twin
Balancing picking and outbound loading efficiency in an SBS/RS through a digital twin,Paper Metadata,Paper DOI,10.1007/s10696-024-09554-w
Balancing picking and outbound loading efficiency in an SBS/RS through a digital twin,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,"Warehouses are essential elements of almost every Supply Chain and have a significant impact on its performance. However, existing research on warehouse operations mainly aims at maximizing operational performance, neglecting their effect on downstream nodes. In this paper, we propose the use of a digital twin (DT) to support warehouse managers to identify the picking policy that most effectively balances picking and outbound loading efficiencies in an SBS/RS, with the aim of providing both a cost-effective and timely delivery to the subsequent nodes. The problem is set referring to a real case study of the logistics hub of a tire distributor company. The DT was built and validated based on real data from plant sensors and information systems. Afterwards, the DT was used to define three picking strategies that differently impact on both picking and outbound loading efficiency. The DT was then employed on a daily basis and fed with real orders, machine and rack availability to replicate stocking and picking operations and to directly communicate the recommended picking strategy to the warehouse PLC. Several demand scenarios have been considered to extend managerial inferences. Results show that the DT is a valuable tool to support the balancing of picking and outbound loading performance."

Beyond digital shadows: A Digital Twin for monitoring earthwork operation in large infrastructure projects,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,"Current research on Digital Twin (DT) is largely focused on the performance of built assets in their operational phases as well as on urban environment. However, Digital Twin has not been given enough attention to construction phases, for which this paper proposes a Digital Twin framework for the construction phase, develops a DT prototype and tests it for the use case of measuring the productivity and monitoring of earthwork operation. The DT framework and its prototype are underpinned by the principles of versatility, scalability, usability and automation to enable the DT to fulfil the requirements of large-sized earthwork projects and the dynamic nature of their operation. Cloud computing and dashboard visualisation were deployed to enable automated and repeatable data pipelines and data analytics at scale and to provide insights in near-real time. The testing of the DT prototype in a motorway project in the Northeast of England successfully demonstrated its ability to produce key insights by using the following approaches: (i) To predict equipment utilisation ratios and productivities; (ii) To detect the percentage of time spent on different tasks (i.e., loading, hauling, dumping, returning or idling), the distance travelled by equipment over time and the speed distribution; and (iii) To visualise certain earthwork operations.

Beyond Digital Twins: Phygital Twins for Neuroergonomics in Human-Robot Interaction,Paper Metadata,Paper DOI,10.3389/fnbot.2022.913605
Beyond Digital Twins: Phygital Twins for Neuroergonomics in Human-Robot Interaction,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,"Among the most recent enabling technologies, Digital Twins (DTs) emerge as data-intensive network-based computing solutions in multiple domains-from Industry 4.0 to Connected Health. A DT works as a virtual system for replicating, monitoring, predicting, and improving the processes and the features of a physical system-the Physical Twin (PT), connected in real-time with its DT. This position paper proposes a physical-digital twinning approach to improve the understanding and management of the PT in Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) contexts according to neuroergonomics. The paper introduces the concept of Phygital Twin (PDT), combining physical and digital elements, enabling intuitive physical interactions and bi-directional real-time data flow between PT and DT. The PDT integrates virtual models and physical replicas within extended reality environments to enhance expert interaction and system assessment, particularly in neuroergonomics and HRI."

Blockchain-based digital twin data provenance for predictive asset management in building facilities,Paper Metadata,Paper DOI,10.1108/SASBE-07-2023-0169
Blockchain-based digital twin data provenance for predictive asset management in building facilities,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,"Purpose -The purpose of this study is to focus on structured data provision and asset information model maintenance and develop a data provenance model on a blockchain-based digital twin smart and sustainable built environment (DT) for predictive asset management (PAM) in building facilities. Design/methodology/approach -Qualitative research data were collected through a comprehensive scoping review of secondary sources. Additionally, primary data were gathered through interviews with industry specialists. The analysis of the data served as the basis for developing blockchain-based DT data provenance models and scenarios. A case study involving a conference room in an office building in Stockholm was conducted to assess the proposed data provenance model. The implementation utilized the Remix Ethereum platform and Sepolia testnet. Findings -Based on the analysis of results, a data provenance model on blockchain-based DT which ensures the reliability and trustworthiness of data used in PAM processes was developed. This was achieved by providing a transparent and immutable record of data origin, ownership and lineage. Practical implications -The proposed model enables decentralized applications (DApps) to publish realtime data obtained from dynamic operations and maintenance processes, enhancing the reliability and effectiveness of data for PAM. Originality/value -The research presents a data provenance model on a blockchain-based DT, specifically tailored to PAM in building facilities. The proposed model enhances decision-making processes related to PAM by ensuring data reliability and trustworthiness and providing valuable insights for specialists and stakeholders interested in the application of blockchain technology in asset management and data provenance."

Chapter 16 : Blockchain Based Digital Twin To Predict Heart Attacks,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,"Digital Twin of a person is a virtual representation of that individual and is a model that can be created with real time data such as age, weight, past medical history and current real time health readings. This research work describes the creation of a Digital Twin that can be used to predict heart attacks thereby enabling doctors to perform proactive medical interventions to save human lives. We have developed an application using a headless architecture to enable seamless integration with other medical devices for other critical health conditions. We have used blockchain for security and machine learning to predict heart attacks. The results of our implementation show that heart attack can be predicted with 97.1% accuracy and in parallel can immediately notify the doctors of an imminent heart attack risk in real time using an email. We have also shown that our implementation is tamper proof and highly reliable by testing the application using the concept of Chaos engineering."

Blockchain-enabled digital twin system for brain stroke prediction,Paper Metadata,Paper title,Blockchain-enabled digital twin system for brain stroke prediction
Blockchain-enabled digital twin system for brain stroke prediction,Paper Metadata,Paper DOI,10.1186/s40708-024-00247-6
Blockchain-enabled digital twin system for brain stroke prediction,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,"A digital twin is a virtual model of a real-world system that updates in real-time. In healthcare, digital twins are gaining popularity for monitoring activities like diet, physical activity, and sleep. However, their application in predicting serious conditions such as heart attacks, brain strokes and cancers remains under investigation, with current research showing limited accuracy in such predictions. Moreover, concerns around data security and privacy continue to challenge the widespread adoption of these models. To address these challenges, we developed a secure, machine learning powered digital twin application with three main objectives enhancing prediction accuracy, strengthening security, and ensuring scalability. The application achieved an accuracy of 98.28% for brain stroke prediction on the selected dataset. The data security was enhanced by integrating consortium blockchain technology with machine learning. The results show that the application is tamperproof and is capable of detecting and automatically correcting backend data anomalies to maintain robust data protection. The application can be extended to monitor other pathologies such as heart attacks, cancers, osteoporosis, and epilepsy with minimal configuration changes."

Blockchain-secure patient Digital Twin in healthcare using smart contracts,Paper Metadata,Paper title,Blockchain-secure patient Digital Twin in healthcare using smart contracts
Blockchain-secure patient Digital Twin in healthcare using smart contracts,Paper Metadata,Paper DOI,10.1371/journal.pone.0286120
Blockchain-secure patient Digital Twin in healthcare using smart contracts,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,"Modern healthcare has a sharp focus on data aggregation and processing technologies. Consequently, from a data perspective, a patient may be regarded as a timestamped list of medical conditions and their corresponding corrective interventions. Technologies to securely aggregate and access data for individual patients in the quest for precision medicine have led to the adoption of Digital Twins in healthcare. Digital Twins are used in manufacturing and engineering to produce digital models of physical objects that capture the essence of device operation to enable and drive optimization. Thus, a patient's Digital Twin can significantly improve health data sharing. However, creating the Digital Twin from multiple data sources, such as the patient's electronic medical records (EMR) and personal health records (PHR) from wearable devices, presents some risks to the security of the model and the patient. The constituent data for the Digital Twin should be accessible only with permission from relevant entities and thus requires authentication, privacy, and provable provenance. This paper proposes a blockchain-secure patient Digital Twin that relies on smart contracts to automate the updating and communication processes that maintain the Digital Twin. The smart contracts govern the response the Digital Twin provides when queried, based on policies created for each patient. We highlight four research points: access control, interaction, privacy, and security of the Digital Twin and we evaluate the Digital Twin in terms of latency in the network, smart contract execution times, and data storage costs."

Building Internet of Things-Enabled Digital Twins and Intelligent Applications Using a Real-time Linked Dataspace,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,"Smart environments have emerged in the form of smart cities, smart buildings, smart energy, smart water, and smart mobility. A key challenge in delivering smart environments is creating intelligent applications for end-users using the new digital infrastructures within the environment. In this chapter, we reflect on the experience of developing Internet of Things-based digital twins and intelligent applications within five different smart environments from an airport to a school. The goal has been to engage users within Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled smart environments to increase water and energy awareness, management, and conservation. The chapter covers the role of a Real-time Linked Dataspace to enable the creation of digital twins, and an evaluation of intelligent applications."

Can we benefit from game engines to develop digital twins for planning the deployment of photovoltaics?,Paper Metadata,Paper DOI,10.1186/s42162-022-00222-7
Can we benefit from game engines to develop digital twins for planning the deployment of photovoltaics?,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,"Digital Twins (DTs) have attracted great attention in the energy sector. Game engines have been suggested to model DTs of their physical counterparts because they provide realistic graphics, lighting-, fluid-and physics engines that simulate the real world. However, the application of game engines to develop DTs for photovoltaics (PVs)  has not yet been discussed in the literature. Therefore, this paper assesses the built-in game engine features' ability to support the DT development of PVs with Unreal Engine 5. This paper mainly focuses on visual representation because the surrounding environment significantly impacts PV deployment, and the existing software tools do not allow the study of the environmental factors at the early planning phase of a project's lifecycle. Furthermore, this paper investigates the position of the sun, shadows and reflections from nearby objects that influence the PVs' power output, and if the built-in light engine can be used for planning the deployment of PVs. The result shows that ingame objects in the environment can be used to affect the simulated PV output estimate over a year. It also indicates that applying Unreal Engine 5 to model PV systems that rely on mirroring real-world behaviour is promising if accurate data is used in the modelling. Real data and mathematical PV models are necessary since Unreal Engine 5's Lumen subsystem cannot provide realistic solar radiance on PVs for a given location on earth."

Chatter model for enabling a digital twin in machining,Paper Metadata,Paper DOI,10.1007/s00170-020-06028-9
Chatter model for enabling a digital twin in machining,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,This paper presents the development of a new chatter model using measured cutting forces instead of a mathematical model with empirical nature that describes them. The utilisation of measured cutting forces enables the prediction of real-time chatter conditions and stable machining. The chatter model is validated using fast Fourier transform (FFT) analyses for detection of chatter. The key contribution of the developed chatter model is that it can be incorporated in digital twins for process monitoring and control in order to achieve greater material removal rates and improved surface quality in future industrial applications involving machining processes.

Circular Economy Advances with Artificial Intelligence and Digital Twin: Multiple-Case Study of Chinese Industries in Agriculture,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,"The population growth is drastically surging in demand for food and water and uplifting consumption and waste resulting in overburden of society and the environment. Urgent actions are required to address these emerging global issues. Therefore, adopting a circular economy (CE) is essential to sustain the consumption rate and accommodate the ever-increasing demand. Moreover, the CE practices accelerate the progress on sustainable development. From this perspective, digital technologies are playing driving roles in the successful implementations of CE practices and achievements of the United Nations' (UN) sustainable development goals (SDGs). Among various emerging digital technologies, artificial intelligence (AI) and digital twin ((DT) are the promising ones. This paper aims to understand and explore how both technologies facilitate the CE transitions and attain SDGs in the agriculture domain. To this end, we provide insights into the concepts of CE, AI, and DT with preliminary and current research status. This research evaluates the contributions of global organizations for CE transitions. We elaborate on the significant contributions of AI and DT in the transition towards CE and identify some challenges that hinder the adoption of these technologies. Besides expanding knowledge, concise multiple case studies are also presented as evidence to depict how companies in China are deploying these technologies to digitize various operations and create solutions for waste management, sustainable resource consumption, renewal energy, water conservation, etc. Findings reveal that these companies successfully attain many SDGs of 1, 2, 6, 7, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, and 17.  This paper enormously contributes to the emerging research domain of integrating CE, AI, DT, and agriculture."

City Information Models (CIMs) as precursors for Urban Digital Twins (UDTs): A case study of Lancaster,Paper Metadata,Paper Abstract,"City Information Models (CIMs) present several research challenges and are arguably pre-cursors for a roadmap to the transition to Urban or City Digital Twins (UDTs/CDTs) and broader smart city drives. In a period of digital transformation in urban planning, CIMs are primarily designed to intersect and merge urban GIS/BIM in what is termed GeoBIM. CIMs are often cloud-based geospatial services and data repositories with one-way data connections, which differ from integrated and high-fidelity cyber-physical complex systems for digital twins (DTs). However, there is a lack of precision in terms of defining CIMs and UDTs, and this paper examines four broad sociotechnical research challenges regarding the progress of CIMs toward full UDTs/CDTs, including (1) technical training for adoption, (2) acquisition strategies for aerial data and remote sensing, (3) data licensing types and system management, and (4) stakeholder engagement with CIM platforms. These four research challenges and digital transformation are discussed by using back-casting futuring methods, establishing a framework for CIMs through co-designed workshops, and explored in the Lancaster City Information Model (LCIM) prototype. The LCIM, as a resulting case study, was developed for architects, planners, and stakeholders to engage with 3D urban models and urban analytics (view sheds, masterplan scenarios, and solar potentials of buildings) from 2019 to 2021 to address digital inequality in planning and data fragmentation. The framework and prototype results resulted in the most extensive 3D open urban dataset published in the UK, consisting of a baseline of 1″+/-buildings and infrastructure and 7.5 cm aerial imagery and a framework for developing transitions from CIMs to UDTs. The delivery of this case and the resulting published dataset highlights the essential research needed regarding definitions and precision around terminology and systems between CIMs and UDTs and four applied challenges in digital transformation and future sociotechnical relationships."

CitySim: A Drone-Based Vehicle Trajectory Dataset for Safety-Oriented Research and Digital Twins,Paper Metadata,Paper DOI,10.1177/03611981231185768
CitySim: A Drone-Based Vehicle Trajectory Dataset for Safety-Oriented Research and Digital Twins,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,"The development of safety-oriented research and applications requires fine-grain vehicle trajectories that not only have high accuracy, but also capture substantial safety-critical events. However, it would be challenging to satisfy both these requirements using the available vehicle trajectory datasets do not have the capacity to satisfy both. This paper introduces the CitySim dataset that has the core objective of facilitating safety-oriented research and applications. CitySim has vehicle trajectories extracted from 1,140-min of drone videos recorded at 12 locations. It covers a variety of road geometries including freeway basic segments, weaving segments, expressway merge/diverge segments, signalized intersections, stop-controlled intersections, and control-free intersections. CitySim was generated through a five-step procedure that ensured trajectory accuracy. The five-step procedure included video stabilization, object filtering, multivideo stitching, object detection and tracking, and enhanced error filtering. Furthermore, CitySim provides the rotated bounding box information of a vehicle, which was demonstrated to improve safety evaluations. Compared with other video-based trajectory datasets, CitySim had significantly more safety-critical events, including cut-in, merge, and diverge events, which were validated by distributions of both minimum time-to-collision and minimum post encroachment time. In addition, CitySim had the capability to facilitate digital-twin-related research by providing relevant assets, such as the recording locations' three-dimensional base maps and signal timings."

Clinical usefulness of digital twin guided virtual amiodarone test in patients with atrial fibrillation ablation Check for updates,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,"It would be clinically valuable if the efficacy of antiarrhythmic drugs could be simulated in advance. We developed a digital twin to predict amiodarone efficacy in high-risk atrial fibrillation (AF) patients postablation. Virtual left atrium models were created from computed tomography and electroanatomical maps to simulate AF and evaluate its response to varying amiodarone concentrations. As the amiodarone concentration increased in the virtual setting, action potential duration lengthened, peak upstroke velocities decreased, and virtual AF termination became more frequent. Patients were classified into effective (those with virtually terminated AF at therapeutic doses) and ineffective groups. The one-year clinical outcomes after AF ablation showed significantly better results in the effective group compared to the ineffective group, with AF recurrence rates of 20.8% vs. 45.1% (log-rank p = 0.031, adjusted hazard ratio, 0.37 [0.14-0.98]; p = 0.046)."

ClinicalGAN: powering patient monitoring in clinical trials with patient digital twins,Paper Metadata,Paper DOI,10.1038/s41598-024-62567-1  
ClinicalGAN: powering patient monitoring in clinical trials with patient digital twins,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,"Conducting clinical trials is becoming increasingly challenging lately due to spiraling costs, increased time to market, and high failure rates. Patient recruitment and retention is one of the key challenges that impact 90% of the trials directly. While a lot of attention has been given to optimizing patient recruitment, limited progress has been made towards developing comprehensive clinical trial monitoring systems to determine patients at risk and potentially improve patient retention through the right intervention at the right time. Earlier research in patient retention primarily focused on using deterministic frameworks to model the inherently stochastic patient journey process. Existing generative approaches to model temporal data such as TimeGAN or CRBM , face challenges and fail to address key requirements such as personalized generation, variable patient journey, and multivariate time-series needed to model patient digital twin. In response to these challenges, current research proposes ClinicalGAN to enable patient level generation, effectively creating a patient's digital twin. ClinicalGAN provides capabilities for: (a) patient-level personalized generation by utilizing patient meta-data for conditional generation; (b) dynamic termination prediction to enable proactive patient monitoring for improved patient retention; (c) multi-variate time-series training to incorporate relationship and dependencies among different tests measures captured during patient journey. The proposed solution is validated on two Alzheimer's clinical trial datasets and the results are benchmarked across multiple dimensions of generation quality. Empirical results demonstrate that the proposed ClinicalGAN outperforms the SOTA approach by 3-4× on average across all the generation quality metrics. Furthermore, the proposed architecture is shown to outperform predictive methods at the task of drop-off prediction significantly (5-10% MAPE scores).  "

Compliance and feedback based model to measure cloud trustworthiness for hosting digital twins,Paper Metadata,Paper title,Compliance and feedback based model to measure cloud trustworthiness for hosting digital twins
Compliance and feedback based model to measure cloud trustworthiness for hosting digital twins,Paper Metadata,Paper DOI,10.1186/s13677-024-00690-0
Compliance and feedback based model to measure cloud trustworthiness for hosting digital twins,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,"Cloud-based digital twins use real-time data from various data sources to simulate the behavior and performance of their physical counterparts, enabling monitoring and analysis. However, one restraining factor in the use of cloud computing for digital twins is its users' concerns about the security of their data. This data may be located anywhere in the cloud, with very limited control of the user to ensure its security. Cloud-based digital twins provide opportunities for researchers to collaborate yet security of such digital twins requires measures specific to cloud computing. To overcome this shortcoming, we need to devise a mechanism that not only ensures essential security safeguards but also computes a Trustworthiness value for Cloud Service Providers (CSP). This would give confidence to cloud users and enable them to choose the right CSP for their data-related interaction. This research proposes a solution, whereby the Trustworthiness of CSPs is calculated based on their Compliance with data security controls, User Feedback, and Auditor Rating. Two additional factors, Accuracy of Compliance Measurement and Control Significance Factor have been built in, to cater for other nonstandard conditions. Our implementation of Data Security Compliance Monitor and Data Trust as a Service, along with three CSPs, each with ten different settings, has supported our proposition through the devised formula. Experimental outcomes show changes in the trustworthiness value with changes in compliance level, user feedback and auditor rating. CSPs with better compliance have better trustworthiness values. However, if the Accuracy of Compliance Measurement and Control Significance Factor are low the trustworthiness is also proportionately less. This creates a balance and realism in our calculations. This model is unique and will help in creating users' trust in cloud-based digital twins."

CONNECTED: leveraging digital twins and personal knowledge graphs in healthcare digitalization,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,"Healthcare has always been a strategic domain in which innovative technologies can be applied to increase the effectiveness of services and patient care quality. Recent advancements have been made in the adoption of Digital Twins (DTs) and Personal Knowledge Graphs (PKGs) in this field. Despite this, their introduction has been hindered by the complex nature of the context itself which leads to many challenges both technical and organizational. In this article, we reviewed the literature about these technologies and their integrations, identifying the most critical requirements for clinical platforms. These latter have been used to design CONNECTED (COmpreheNsive and staNdardized hEalth-Care plaTforms to collEct and harmonize clinical Data), a conceptual framework aimed at defining guidelines to overcome the crucial issues related to the development of healthcare applications. It is structured in a multi-layer shape, in which heterogeneous data sources are first integrated, then standardized, and finally used to realize general-purpose DTs of patients backed by PKGs and accessible through dedicated APIs. These DTs will be the foundation on which smart applications can be built."

Consensus control for distributed power tracking by device-level digital twin agents,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,"The development of electronics and software has resulted in the ability of twin agents to act as digital counterparts for the optimization, control, and monitoring of real power grids. When increasing regulation resources are connected to the power grid, is challenging for independent system operators to use a centralized controller to achieve power tracking and balance. Therefore, the present study applied device-level-based digital twins to monitor physical signals for computer-aided design for power tracking. Moreover, a consensus control-based distributed power tracking system is proposed for the physicalmodel simulation of the power grid. A communication network was also designed for realistic signal exchange. The combination of the proposed distributed power tracking method and communication network can accelerate computational efficiency and protect the privacy of the regulation resources. Finally, the performance of the proposed distributed power tracking method is validated in a simulation system with 10 regulation resources."

Construction Project Management with Digital Twin Information System,Paper Metadata,Paper abstract,"The current stage in the development of the construction industry is its digitalization, which requires the transformation of processes and models based on the use of digital platforms and twins. Datasets in a construction project accumulates quickly and becomes difficult to store and process due to the large file sizes of CAD,GIS and BIM technologies. Managing such datasets is a complex problem, since the usefulness of such data lies in ensuring that it is available and used as needed by all participants in a construction project. The article proposes to develop an information system for creating digital twins of construction project management as an integrator of digital tools based on Big Data Analytics and BIM technology, which is already the standard for the digitalization of the construction industry. The study describes four types of digital twins and ten properties of Big Data required for construction project. Conceptual model of Big Data domains for construction project and BIM-model of Big Data exchange and information transfer for construction project digital twin are considered. The authors propose a framework for creating digital twins of construction project management that uses three main components: BIM-models, Big Data Analytics and Knowledge Base. The results of the study are structure of information system of creating digital twin of territory urban planning project for Design Company and example using a BIMoriented software product."
